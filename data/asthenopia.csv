With the increase in demand for refractive surgeries, there is an enormous strain on the operating surgeon for delivering ideal outcomes i.e 20/20 visual acuity. Regression, under-correction and ectasia are the most dreaded complications post-refractive correction, for the surgeon as well as the patient. They have significant effects on the quantity of the vision and most importantly on the quality of life of the patient. With the advent of digital era and jobs requiring the eyes being glued to the screen for hours there has been a surge in the patients presenting with complaints of asthenopia, glare, halos, and difficulty in focusing; pointing towards diagnosis of non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies (NSBVA). NSBVA in a postrefractive surgery patient may masquerade as regression or under-correction. However, timely diagnosis of NSBVA in such patients would prevent the greater harm caused by wrongful re-correction. Home- and office-based vision therapy results in improvement in visual acuity in a large majority of these patients. This preferred practice pattern intends to guide the refractive surgeons to diagnose and treat the postrefractive surgery NSBVA following a case-based and algorithmic approach. It also emphasizes the inclusion of the binocular vision assessment as a part of the pre-operative workup for patients undergoing refractive procedures.","['Muthu, Sumitha', 'Jethani, Jitendra', 'Annavajjhala, Sriram', 'Gupta, Sneha', 'Gupta, Krati', 'Khamar, Pooja']","['Muthu S', 'Jethani J', 'Annavajjhala S', 'Gupta S', 'Gupta K', 'Khamar P']","['Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, Narayana Nethralaya, Bangalore, Karnataka, India,, India.', 'Director, Baroda Children Eyecare and Squint Clinic, Vadodara, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Cornea and Refractive Surgery, Narayana Nethralaya, Bangalore, Karnataka, India,, India.', 'Department of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, Narayana Nethralaya, Bangalore, Karnataka, India,, India.', 'Department of Cornea and Refractive Surgery, Narayana Nethralaya, Bangalore, Karnataka, India,, India.', 'Department of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, Narayana Nethralaya, Bangalore, Karnataka, India,, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Ophthalmol,Indian journal of ophthalmology,0405376,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Glare', 'NSBVA', 'preferred practice patterns', 'refractive surgery', 'regression']",['None'],2020/11/25 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/11/24 05:57'],"['2020/11/24 05:57 [entrez]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJOphthalmol_2020_68_12_2835_301261 [pii]', '10.4103/ijo.IJO_2724_20 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Ophthalmol. 2020 Dec;68(12):2835-2846. doi: 10.4103/ijo.IJO_2724_20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, dental therapy involving prolonged use of DOMs requires precision within a limited visual field, resulting in eye strain among users. This study examined the effects of halogen and light-emitting diode (LED) light sources on asthenopia and visual function following use of DOMs. METHODS: The study used halogen and LED light sources in DOMs. The first experiment was conducted on 6 participants with corrected visual acuity without any organic eye disease. General visual function test (calculation ability test, hand grip strength test, and ophthalmic examination) and subjective symptom questionnaire were used to evaluate the degree of fatigue before and after DOM use. The second experiment was conducted on 9 participants with spherical equivalents within +/- 4 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1 D or less. Accommodative function tests (precise test for asthenopia) and a subjective symptom questionnaire (asthenopia) were used before and after use of DOM. RESULTS: No significant changes were noted in the degree of fatigue and ophthalmological parameters before and after the procedure with either light source or in between light sources. The tear firm breakup time was shortened after therapy, and a tendency toward dry eyes was observed while using the LED light source. CONCLUSIONS: The halogen and LED light sources used for DOM therapy had similar effects on asthenopia of the operators, with no significant changes in visual function.","['Nakahira, Kengo', 'Mutoh, Noriko', 'Fuchida, Shinya', 'Yamamoto, Tatsuo', 'Kimijima, Masumi', 'Ichibe, Yoshiaki', 'Tani-Ishii, Nobuyuki']","['Nakahira K', 'Mutoh N', 'Fuchida S', 'Yamamoto T', 'Kimijima M', 'Ichibe Y', 'Tani-Ishii N']","['Division of Pulp Biology, Department of Oral Interdisciplinary.', 'Division of Pulp Biology, Department of Oral Interdisciplinary.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the lockdown on digital device usage, and consequently, the ocular surface health implications and circadian rhythm abnormalities related to digital eye strain. Methods: An open online survey was sent through various social media platforms and was open for a period of 2 weeks. Results: A total of 407 usable responses were obtained; the average age of respondents was 27.4 years. Typically, 93.6% of respondents reported an increase in their screen time since the lockdown was declared. The average increase in digital device usage was calculated at about 4.8 +/- 2.8 h per day. The total usage per day was found to be 8.65 +/- 3.74 hours. Sleep disturbances have been reported by 62.4% of people. Typically, 95.8% of respondents had experienced at least one symptom related to digital device usage, and 56.5% said that the frequency and intensity of these symptoms increased since the lockdown was declared. Conclusion: The study highlighted the drastic increase in use of digital devices after the initiation of the COVID-19 lockdown, and along with it, the slow deterioration of ocular health across all age groups. Awareness about prevention of digital eye strain should be stressed, and going forward, measures to bring these adverse effects to a minimum should be explored.","['Bahkir, Fayiqa Ahamed', 'Grandee, Srinivasan Subramanian']","['Bahkir FA', 'Grandee SS']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Karpaga Vinayaga Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Chengalpet, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Karpaga Vinayaga Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Chengalpet, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Ophthalmol,Indian journal of ophthalmology,0405376,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'digital eye strain', 'ocular surface health']",['None'],2020/10/31 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/10/30 01:01'],"['2020/10/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJOphthalmol_2020_68_11_2378_299052 [pii]', '10.4103/ijo.IJO_2306_20 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Ophthalmol. 2020 Nov;68(11):2378-2383. doi: 10.4103/ijo.IJO_2306_20.,,,20201106,"['COVID-19', 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2']",['Indian J Ophthalmol. 2020 Nov;68(11):2383-2384.

Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of asthenopia among a sample of university students attending various majors and to identify the risk factors for its development. Methods: This is a cross sectional study conducted on students attending various faculties at the American University of Beirut during the spring semester of 2019. Students were asked to fill a self-administered anonymous questionnaire that inquired about demographics, use of digital devices, symptoms of asthenopia, possible risk factors and protective measures. A bivariate analysis was performed to correlate asthenopia with the different variables. A multivariate analysis was then conducted to determine the extent of contribution of the different variables to asthenopia after controlling for confounding variables. Results: The prevalence of asthenopia was found to be 67.8% with blurred vision being the most reported symptom (27.0%). A bivariate analysis was used to assess the association between asthenopia and the following variables: demographics, digital device use, reasons for using digital devices, and preventive methods. Age, being a continuous variable, was analyzed using an independent t- test. For the variables that were found to be have a p-value < 0.2, a multiple logistic regression was performed. Old age was found to be a protective factor for asthenopia, with 0.693 times reduction in asthenopia for every increase in year of age. Using the device for communication for less than four hours (p=0.012), using the device for less than four hours per day (p=0.000) and pattern of using the device for less than three years (p=0.023) were significant in being negatively associated with asthenopia. As for preventative measures that protect users from digital eyestrain, we found that using eye drops (p=0.004; OR=0.375) and taking regular breaks (p=0.000; OR= 0.399) were protective factors whereas using adjustable screens was a risk factor (p=0.000; OR=3.083). Conclusion: Asthenopia was found to be of non-negligible prevalence among this sample of university students. The results of this study highlight the importance of establishing awareness campaigns and encourage the introduction of targeted screenings for asthenopia among college students.","['Touma Sawaya, Rayah Issam', 'El Meski, Nour', 'Saba, Joelle Bou', 'Lahoud, Chloe', 'Saab, Lea', 'Haouili, Maya', 'Shatila, Malek', 'Aidibe, Zeinab', 'Musharrafieh, Umayya']","['Touma Sawaya RI', 'El Meski N', 'Saba JB', 'Lahoud C', 'Saab L', 'Haouili M', 'Shatila M', 'Aidibe Z', 'Musharrafieh U']","['Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Family Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Family Med Prim Care,Journal of family medicine and primary care,101610082,,['NOTNLM'],"['Lebanon', 'asthenopia', 'digital device', 'prevalence', 'risk factors', 'university students']",['There are no conflicts of interest.'],2020/10/29 06:00,2020/10/29 06:01,['2020/10/28 05:41'],"['2020/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_340_20 [doi]', 'JFMPC-9-3921 [pii]']",epublish,J Family Med Prim Care. 2020 Aug 25;9(8):3921-3932. doi: 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_340_20. eCollection 2020 Aug.,['Copyright: (c) 2020 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.'],20200825,,,,,PMC7586504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 76 volunteers were recruited for this study. Subjects watched UHD TV for 10 minutes at a viewing distance of 110 cm. Best-corrected visual acuity, refractive errors, tear break-up time, corneal staining grading, conjunctival redness grading by slit-lamp examination, tear meniscus measurement by anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and ocular symptom scores were obtained before and immediately after watching UHD TV. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to participant age (old age group &gt;50 years vs. young age group </=50 years) and dry-eye syndrome (presence vs. absence). The relationship between subjective and objective indices was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of subjects was 39.6 +/- 12.4 years. Watching UHD TV induced a decrease in tear break-up time in the non-dry-eye group (p &lt; 0.001) but not in the dry-eye group (p = 0.726). Corneal staining grades increased in all subgroups, and the changes were particularly larger in the older group (p = 0.038). The increase in ocular symptom scores was larger in the dry-eye group (p = 0.08) and in the older group (p = 0.016). The decrease in tear break-up time and ocular symptom scores after watching UHD TV was significantly correlated with tear break-up time. CONCLUSIONS: Tear break-up time significantly decreased in non-dry-eye subjects after watching UHD TV. Subjective ocular discomfort increased significantly in subjects over the age of 50 and in participants with dry-eye syndrome.","['Kim, Hyuna', 'Yang, Hee Kyung', 'Seo, Jong-Mo', 'Lee, Sanghoon', 'Hwang, Jeong-Min']","['Kim H', 'Yang HK', 'Seo JM', 'Lee S', 'Hwang JM']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju, Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'School of Electrical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Korean J Ophthalmol,Korean journal of ophthalmology : KJO,8804513,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Asthenopia', '*Dry eye syndromes', '*Ocular surface index', '*Ultra-high-definition television']",,2020/10/26 06:00,2020/10/26 06:00,['2020/10/25 20:15'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/25 20:15 [entrez]', '2020/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['kjo.2020.0032 [pii]', '10.3341/kjo.2020.0032 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Ophthalmol. 2020 Oct;34(5):367-374. doi: 10.3341/kjo.2020.0032.

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether the incorporation of Borsting et al's 2003 Revised Convergence-Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) into a general school vision screening could aid in the identification of children with visual discomfort and indicate the need for further investigation. METHODS: Vision screening of an unselected middle school population investigated and analysed the incidence of self-reported nearwork-related visual discomfort via the CISS along with distance and near visual acuities plus non-cycloplegic autorefraction using a Shin-Nippon NVision-K 5001. RESULTS: Of the 384 unselected students approached in Grades 6-9, 353 participated (92.2%, mean 13.2 +/- 1.4 years). The mean CISS score for the population without amblyopia and/or strabismus (96.0% of all students) was 16.8 +/- 0.6, i.e., 45% of students in this cohort had CISS scores greater than one standard deviation above the mean found by Borsting et al. in 2003 during their validation study of the CISS on 9 to 18 year old children without binocular anomalies. Regression analyses indicated significantly higher (p < 0.001) mean CISS scores for the 3.2% who were hyperopes >/= + 2.00D by non-cycloplegic autorefraction (27.7 +/- 14.7) and for those who were amblyopic (24.3 +/- 6.6) or strabismic (34.0 +/- 9.8). The mean CISS score of 31.6 +/- 9.0 for non-amblyopic/strabismic students having near vision poorer than 0.1 LogMAR was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than for those with good acuity. CONCLUSION: The most important finding of this study was the high incidence of asthenopia in an unselected population and that refractive status per se was not a major contributor to CISS scores. The results highlight the usefulness of the CISS questionnaire for assessment of visual discomfort in school vision screenings and the need for future exploration of near binocular vision status as a potential driver of asthenopia in school students, especially given current trends for frequent daily use of computers and handheld devices and necessarily prolonged accommodative-convergence effort at near, both at school and at home.","['Junghans, Barbara M', 'Azizoglu, Serap', 'Crewther, Sheila G']","['Junghans BM', 'Azizoglu S', 'Crewther SG']","['School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, 3086, Australia. b.junghans@unsw.edu.au.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia. b.junghans@unsw.edu.au.', 'School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, 3086, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Deakin University, Geelong, Victoria, 3220, Australia.', 'School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, 3086, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Ophthalmol,BMC ophthalmology,100967802,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Middle school; CISS questionnaire', 'Refractive error']",,2020/10/14 06:00,2020/10/14 06:00,['2020/10/13 05:27'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/13 05:27 [entrez]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12886-020-01642-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12886-020-01642-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Ophthalmol. 2020 Oct 12;20(1):408. doi: 10.1186/s12886-020-01642-3.,,20201012,,,,,PMC7549207,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2089-7965'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the utility of B-B filters is a matter of debate and discussion by the scientific community due to the lack of evidence supporting their use. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of using B-B filters on the dynamics of the accommodative response and pupil size and perceived levels of visual discomfort, while performing a 30-min reading task at a close distance in subjects who routinely use electronic devices. METHODS: Nineteen healthy young adults (22.0 +/- 2.7 years) read two 30-min passages on a computer screen placed at 50 cm, either while using a commercially available B-B filter or without any filter on two different days. The magnitude and variability of both the accommodative response and pupil size were dynamically measured for 60 s using the WAM-5500 open field autorefractometer at 4-5, 9-10, 14-15, 19-20, 24-25, and 29-30 min into the trial. The perceived levels of visual discomfort were also obtained. RESULTS: The lag and variability of accommodation were insensitive to the blue light level (p = 0.34 and 0.62, respectively). There was a time-on-task effect for the variability of accommodation, showing greater instability over time regardless of the blue light level. The use of the B-B filter was associated with improved reading speed (p = 0.02), with an increase of 16.5 words per minute. However, it was not associated with any significant change in pupil dynamics or the perceived levels of visual discomfort (p> 0.05 in both cases). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that the use of a B-B filter had no effect on accommodative dynamics or visual symptomatology. Based on these findings, there is no support for the prescription of B-B filters to attenuate the visual symptoms and signs associated with the use of electronic devices in healthy young adults.","['Redondo, Beatriz', 'Vera, Jesus', 'Ortega-Sanchez, Alba', 'Molina, Ruben', 'Jimenez, Raimundo']","['Redondo B', 'Vera J', 'Ortega-Sanchez A', 'Molina R', 'Jimenez R']","['Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*accommodation', '*asthenopia', '*computer vision syndrome']",,2020/10/02 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/10/01 12:16'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 12:16 [entrez]']",['10.1111/opo.12738 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2020 Nov;40(6):790-800. doi: 10.1111/opo.12738.

Despite the enormity of the available information, there is a significant lack of clarity regarding the criteria for definition, methodology adopted for testing and diagnosis, and the varied prevalence across the globe. This review aims to gather evidence that is pertinent to the prevalence, impact and efficacy of available treatment options for AI. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Collaboration search engines were used with the keywords prevalence, accommodative insufficiency, symptoms, plus lens, vision therapy and treatment. Peer-reviewed articles published between 1992 and 2019 were included in the review. After reviewing the studies for study methodology and robustness, 83 articles were chosen for this literature review. Results: The prevalence of AI ranges between <1.00% and 61.6% across studies. The prevalence shows considerable variation across ethnicities and age groups. There is significant variation in the study methodology, diagnostic criteria and number of tests performed to arrive at the diagnosis. Not many studies have explored the prevalence beyond 20 years of age. The prevalence of AI is high among children with special needs. There is no high-quality evidence regarding the standard treatment protocol for AI. Both vision therapy and low plus lenses have shown efficacy in independent studies, and no studies have compared these two treatment options. Conclusion: The understanding of AI prevalence is currently limited owing to the lack of a standard set of diagnostic criteria and wide variations in the study methodology. There is a lack of high-quality evidence suggesting the best possible treatment for AI. The current gaps in the literature have been identified and future scope for exploration is elucidated.","['Hussaindeen, Jameel Rizwana', 'Murali, Amirthaa']","['Hussaindeen JR', 'Murali A']","['Binocular Vision Clinic, Sankara Nethralaya, Unit of Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai 600006, India.', 'Elite School of Optometry (in Collaboration with SASTRA Deemed University), Unit of Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai 600016, India.', 'Elite School of Optometry (in Collaboration with SASTRA Deemed University), Unit of Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai 600016, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Clin Optom (Auckl),Clinical optometry,101730504,,['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation insufficiency', 'accommodative facility', 'amplitude of accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'binocular vision', 'lag of accommodation', 'plus lens', 'vision therapy']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:38'],"['2020/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OPTO.S224216 [doi]', '224216 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Optom (Auckl). 2020 Sep 11;12:135-149. doi: 10.2147/OPTO.S224216. eCollection 2020.,['(c) 2020 Hussaindeen and Murali.'],20200911,,,,,PMC7494425,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6569-5251'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the construct of eye fatigue remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to quantify the relationship among symptoms most frequently associated with eye fatigue in those using digital devices. METHODS: Six hundred and two soft contact lens (SCL) wearers and 127 non-contact lens (non-CL) wearers who reported using digital devices at least 4 hours per day completed a questionnaire assessing the frequency and severity of ten symptoms commonly associated with digital device-related eye fatigue. Subjective ratings were made separately for each symptom using unipolar, five-point Likert scales. RESULTS: From the initial pool of respondents, 89 % of the SCL wearers reported experiencing eye fatigue more than once per month, while over 60 % reported more than once per week. Notably, eye fatigue frequency did not differ between the soft contact and non-contact lens groups. Although eye strain/pain, dryness, and tired eyes were the most frequently endorsed symptoms by both groups, only dryness and eye irritation were significant factors that discriminated the SCL from the non-CL wearers on the basis of frequency and severity. Principal component analysis indicated that eye strain/pain, soreness, tired eyes, and headaches may comprise a ""primary sensations"" factor, whereas burning, eye irritation, tearing and dryness comprise a ""secondary or surface sensations"" factor, and blurred/double vision and words move/float comprise a ""visual sensations"" factor. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of frequency and severity ratings for SCL wearers yielded excellent fits (RMSEA = 0.046 and 0.050, respectively) with construct reliabilities ranging from 0.729 to 0.824. CONCLUSION: Frequent and severe eye fatigue is highly prevalent among both soft contact lens and non-contact lens wearers. Those utilizing SCL do not experience symptoms at higher frequency or severity. Key descriptors of digital eye fatigue have been identified and may then be used to help identify and evaluate specific causative, palliative, or ameliorating factors.","['Meyer, Dawn', 'Rickert, Martin', 'Kollbaum, Pete']","['Meyer D', 'Rickert M', 'Kollbaum P']","['Indiana University School of Optometry, 800 E.

METHODS: Using a multi-stage random cluster sampling, 1211 high school students (481 males and 730 females) between 13 and 18 years of age were selected and examined. Visual acuity, stereoacuity and suppression, refractive errors, near point of convergence, heterophoria and fusional vergences, as well as, amplitude of accommodation, accommodative response, facility and relative accommodation were evaluated. The validity of the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey to distinguish between children with and those without anomalies in the clinical measures were characterized using the Receiver Operation Curve, sensitivity and specificity of the tests. RESULTS: The overall mean and standard deviation for symptoms score was 27.38+/-11.04. Deficient accommodative measures revealed worse symptoms scores than did deficient vergence measures and children with deficient clinical measures had significantly higher mean symptoms scores. (p=0.001) However, the correlations between defective clinical measures and symptoms were significant but relatively weak. The Receiver Operation Curve showed that the clinical measures with the highest sensitivities using the CISS (>/=16) were: reduced amplitude of accommodation 0.63, 95% Confidence interval, 0.59-0.68%) accommodative facility 0.62 (95% Confidence interval, 0.58-0.67) and near point of convergence 0.60 (95% Confidence interval, 0.53-0.67). CONCLUSION: Deficient clinical measures and symptoms of asthenopia are prevalent and correlated in the sample of school children studied. Overall, findings suggest that high school children with deficient clinical measures may be symptomatic when they perform intense near task compared to those without deficiencies. In addition, although validated for convergence insufficiency, the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey could barely distinguish between children with and without defective clinical measures. Findings highlight the need for and provide baseline data towards possible validation of a fast and reliable screening tool for vision anomalies. Further studies on similar populations are needed to confirm these findings and add to knowledge base.","['Wajuihian, Samuel Otabor']",['Wajuihian SO'],"['Discipline of Optometry, School of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Private Bag X54001, Durban 4000, South Africa.

It is sometimes severe enough to reduce the quality of life. Several studies have investigated the treatment effects of orthokeratology (Ortho-K) and topical atropine on anisomyopia control. However, no study has compared these two interventions simultaneously until now. The cohort of this retrospective study included 124 children with anisomyopia who were treated with binocular Ortho-K lenses, 0.01% atropine, or 0.05% atropine. After a 2-year follow-up, the inter-eye difference in axial length (AL) significantly decreased in the Ortho-K group (P = 0.015) and remained stable in the two atropine groups. When comparing the myopia control effect, the use of Ortho-K lenses resulted in an obviously smaller change in AL than the use of 0.01% and 0.05% atropine (P < 0.01). Ortho-K treatment may reduce the degree of anisomyopia and stabilise the progression of myopia. Hence, Ortho-K might be a better choice for anisomyopic children.","['Tsai, Wei-Shan', 'Wang, Jen-Hung', 'Chiu, Cheng-Jen']","['Tsai WS', 'Wang JH', 'Chiu CJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, No. 707, Sec. 3, Chung-Yang Road, Hualien, 97002, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, No. 707, Sec. 3, Chung-Yang Road, Hualien, 97002, Taiwan. drcjchiu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan. drcjchiu@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,,,2020/08/28 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2020/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-71142-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-71142-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Aug 25;10(1):14176. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-71142-3.,,20200825,,,,,PMC7447800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective review of 9 consecutive VITOM 3D-assisted parotidectomies was carried out. All of the cases included had benign pathology. Eight of the tumors were in the superficial lobe whereas one case arose in the deep lobe. Superficial parotidectomy type II, according to the ESGS classification, was performed in 5 cases (55.6%): type I-II in 2 cases (22.2%), type I and III in 1 case respectively (11.1%). The postoperative period was uneventful for all of the patients, and no cases of postoperative temporary or definite facial nerve palsy or other complications were reported. The mean operating time was 145 minutes (range 135-165 minutes). Asthenopia never occurred, and there were no cases in which the first surgeon, the assistants, or the nurses needed to interrupt the 3D vision. VITOM 3D has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for parotid gland surgery. The main advantages of VITOM 3D are improved visualization, ergonomics, versatility, training, and education. The drawbacks are related to asthenopia and the learning curve, even though, in our experience, the impact of these factors is minimal.","['Mincione, Antonio', 'Lepera, Davide', 'Rizzi, Lucio']","['Mincione A', 'Lepera D', 'Rizzi L']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Ospedale Forlanini.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Ospedale Nuovo di Legnano, ASST Ovest Milanese, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Ospedale Nuovo di Legnano, ASST Ovest Milanese, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Craniofac Surg,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,9010410,D,,,,2020/08/25 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/08/25 06:00'],"['2020/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/SCS.0000000000006875 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Craniofac Surg. 2020 Aug 20. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000006875.,,20200820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

32687296,NLM,MEDLINE,20201027,0042-8787 (Print) 0042-8787 (Linking),97,4,2020,[The scientific rationale for the use of electroneurostimulation of the cervical sympathetic ganglia in patients with computer vision syndrome].,17-25,10.17116/kurort20209704117 [doi],"A frequent reason for visiting an ophthalmologist for patients of working age is computer vision syndrome (CVS): statistics show that up to 90% of users of personal electronic computers (PCs) suffer from this disease. Therefore, the actual task of modern rehabilitation medicine and ophthalmology is the search for an effective and safe way to prevent and treat the CVS among employees of enterprises. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY: Was a scientific justification, an assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the use of electroneurostimulation (ENS) of the cervical sympathetic ganglia in patients with CVS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 120 patients with the syndrome observed on an outpatient basis were examined. Patients were divided into 3 groups using simple randomization method. The 1st group (the main group - MG) included 39 patients who, against the background of gymnastics of the oculomotor muscles and muscles of the shoulder girdle, used ENS on the area of the sympathetic ganglia; in the 2nd group (group of comparison - GoC) included 41 patients who strictly performed the same muscle gymnastics (after every 2 hours of work with the PC); Group 3 (control group - CG) consisted of 40 patients who took an ENS course of exposure in placebo mode. In the dynamics, the stock of relative accommodation, near heterophory, tear production, threshold electrical sensitivity of the retina, electrolability of the optic nerve, contrast sensitivity, reading speed, print speed and accuracy and the level of subjective asthenopia were evaluated. RESULTS: Initially, groups of patients with CVS did not differ among themselves in any of the investigated parameters. After a course of procedures in the MG, in contrast to the other two (GoC and CG), statistically significant positive shifts were revealed in relation to the selected endpoints, reflecting the severity of asthenopia, sensorineural, accommodative and oculomotor functions of the visual analyzer, as well as ophthalmoergonomics. Of the side effects of the procedures were recorded: moderate drowsiness (in 4 patients), a feeling of heaviness of the head (in 1 patient) and an increase in blood pressure (BP) by more than 15% of the initial (in 1 patient). They disappeared on their own and did not require withdrawal of treatment. A patient who noted a single increase in blood pressure subsequently received therapy every other day. Redness of the skin of the neck in the area of application of the electrodes was found with the same frequency in MG and CG. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of ENS in the rehabilitation treatment of workers professionally using a personal computer significantly increases the effectiveness of therapeutic measures, which proves the appropriateness of applying the proposed technology in CVS. The therapeutic action of complex therapy is realized through the effect of the ENS on an important reflexogenic zone - the cervical sympathetic ganglia, the activation of which ensures the normalization of the central, peripheral and autonomic functioning of the visual analyzer. Analysis of the frequency of registration of side effects in patients of the three groups allows us to conclude that the technique is safe.","['Nikiforova, A A', 'Gusova, B A', 'Korotkikh, S A', 'Fedorov, A A', 'Kaysinova, A S']","['Nikiforova AA', 'Gusova BA', 'Korotkikh SA', 'Fedorov AA', 'Kaysinova AS']","['Ural State Medical University, Ekaterinburg, Russia.', 'Pyatigorsk Medical and Pharmaceutical Institute - a branch of Volgograd State Medical University, Pyatigorsk, Russia.', 'Ural State Medical University, Ekaterinburg, Russia.', 'Ural State Medical University, Ekaterinburg, Russia.', 'Yekaterinburg Medical Research Center for Prophylaxis and Health Protection in Industrial Workers, Yekaterinburg, Russia.', 'Pyatigorsk Medical and Pharmaceutical Institute - a branch of Volgograd State Medical University, Pyatigorsk, Russia.', 'North Caucasus Federal Scientific and Clinical Center, Essentuki, Russia.']",['rus'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Russia (Federation),Vopr Kurortol Fizioter Lech Fiz Kult,"Voprosy kurortologii, fizioterapii, i lechebnoi fizicheskoi kultury",2984868R,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['computer vision syndrome', 'electroneurostimulation', 'ophthalmoergonomics']",,2020/07/21 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17116/kurort20209704117 [doi]'],ppublish,Vopr Kurortol Fizioter Lech Fiz Kult. 2020;97(4):17-25. doi: 10.17116/kurort20209704117.,,,20201027,,,"['*Asthenopia', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic', 'Humans']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6672-6726', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5979-9185', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3302-1759', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9199-1545', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1199-3303']",Nauchnoe obosnovanie primeneniya elektroneirostimulyatsii sheinykh simpaticheskikh gangliev u patsientov s komp'yuternym zritel'nym sindromom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An alternative nutritional strategy is needed to prevent the aggravation of eye fatigue symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the protective effect of a novel botanical combination of lutein ester, zeaxanthin, and extracts of blackcurrant, chrysanthemum, and goji berry on adults with eye fatigue in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: We randomly allocated 360 participants into 4 groups to receive placebo and 3 doses of our formula (chewable tablets, containing 6 mg, 10 mg, or 14 mg of lutein) once daily for 90 d. Each participant had 3 visits at baseline (V1), 45 d (V2), and 90 d (V3) during the study. RESULTS: Intervention with the formula improved individual scores of eye fatigue symptoms, including eye soreness, blurred vision, dry eye, foreign body sensation, and tearing. Compared with placebo, the formula at all 3 doses significantly decreased the total score of eye fatigue symptoms and increased the visuognosis persistence time at both V2 and V3. According to the Schirmer test, both 10-mg and 14-mg lutein formula groups had improved tear secretion at V3 compared with the placebo. The keratography results indicated that the first tear break-up time, average tear break-up time, and tear meniscus height were significantly increased after formula intervention. The formula at all 3 doses significantly increased the macular pigment optical density at V2 and V3 compared with the placebo, whereas optical coherence tomography showed no significant difference in retinal thickness and retinal volume across all groups at both visits. CONCLUSIONS: Our botanical formula improves eye fatigue, dry eye, and macular function without changing the retinal structure, and thus it could serve as an effective nutritional strategy in improving eye fatigue without causing serious side effects.Clinical Trial Registry: chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR1800018987).","['Kan, Juntao', 'Wang, Min', 'Liu, Ying', 'Liu, Hongyue', 'Chen, Liang', 'Zhang, Xue', 'Huang, Chengrong', 'Liu, Bryan Y', 'Gu, Zhensheng', 'Du, Jun']","['Kan J', 'Wang M', 'Liu Y', 'Liu H', 'Chen L', 'Zhang X', 'Huang C', 'Liu BY', 'Gu Z', 'Du J']","['Nutrilite Health Institute, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Aier Eye Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center, Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Nutrilite Health Institute, Shanghai, China.', 'Nutrilite Health Institute, Shanghai, China.', 'Nutrilite Health Institute, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'College of Biotechnology, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Nutrilite Health Institute, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,AIM IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*blackcurrant', '*chrysanthemum', '*dry eye', '*eye fatigue', '*goji berry', '*keratography', '*lutein', '*macular pigment optical density', '*optical coherence tomography', '*zeaxanthin']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2020/10/07 06:00,['2020/06/17 06:00'],"['2020/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['5857646 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcn/nqaa139 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2020 Aug 1;112(2):334-342. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/nqaa139.,['Copyright (c) The Author(s) on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2020.'],,20201006,"['0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Zeaxanthins)', 'X72A60C9MT (Lutein)']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/*drug therapy', 'Chrysanthemum/*chemistry', 'Dietary Supplements/analysis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lutein/administration & dosage/analysis', 'Lycium/chemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plant Preparations/*administration & dosage/analysis', 'Ribes/*chemistry', 'Visual Acuity/drug effects', 'Young Adult', 'Zeaxanthins/administration & dosage/analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using a multi-stage random cluster sampling, 1211 high school students (481 males and 730 females) between 13 and 18 years of age, were selected and examined. Visual acuity, stereoacuity and suppression, refractive errors, near point of convergence, heterophoria and fusional vergences, as well as, amplitude of accommodation, accommodative response, facility and relative accommodation were evaluated. Correlations among variables and the validity of Randot stereoacuity to distinguish between children with and without defective clinical measures as well as symptomatic versus asymptomatic children were characterized by the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. RESULTS: The overall mean stereoacuity was 43.9+/-25.23s arc, and 18.9% [95% Confidence Interval, 16.6-21.4%)] of the participants had reduced stereoacuity (defined as >/=60). Stereoacuity values and symptoms scores were worse in children with defective clinical measures. The Receiver Operation Curve showed that maximum sensitivity and specificity was obtained with near point of convergence break (>/=10cm) of (0.70 95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.77) with Randot stereoacuity test (defined as >/=60s arc). The correlations between reduced stereoacuity and symptoms scores was moderately strong and statistically significant (Pearson's, r=0.507, p=0.01). The Receiver Operation Curve showed that maximum sensitivity and specificity obtained with the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey was 0.57 (95% Confidence interval=0.53-0.62, p=0.001), sensitivity of 90.26%, and specificity 15.26% with the Randot stereoacuity test. CONCLUSION: Reduced stereoacuity, defective clinical measures and symptoms of asthenopia were prevalent among sample of school children studied. Randot stereoacuity test could fairly distinguish between defective and normal clinical measures; though the accuracy to differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic school children is poor. These findings highlight the need for validation of a simple and fast screening tool in school settings. Further studies to confirm above findings will be needed.","['Wajuihian, Samuel Otabor']",['Wajuihian SO'],"['Discipline of Optometry, School of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Private Bag X54001, Durban 4000, South Africa.

METHODS: Twenty-three volunteers, who played VR games in two modes (immersive and non-immersive) for 30 min, were enrolled. Visual parameters were examined before and after using VR. Accommodative factors were measured using static and dynamic methods. Subjective symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire. Differences according to VR content were compared, and correlations between each visual parameter were analyzed. RESULTS: There were no changes in refraction or accommodative factors after use of the VR. However, there was a significant increase in the near point of accommodation (NPA), the near point of convergence (NPC), and subjective symptom scores after using the immersive mode. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between baseline values of near exophoria and mean accommodative lag of the dominant eye, and also revealed a negative correlation between NPA and mean accommodative lag in the non-dominant eye. CONCLUSIONS: The use of VR for 30 min increased NPA and NPC, especially after the immersive mode was used. In addition, higher exophoria and smaller NPA is associated with increased accommodative lag after using VR.","['Yoon, Hyeon Jeong', 'Kim, Jonghwa', 'Park, Sang Woo', 'Heo, Hwan']","['Yoon HJ', 'Kim J', 'Park SW', 'Heo H']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Chonnam National University Medical School and Hospital, 42 Jebong-ro, Dong-gu, Gwangju, 61469, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Chonnam National University Medical School and Hospital, 42 Jebong-ro, Dong-gu, Gwangju, 61469, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Chonnam National University Medical School and Hospital, 42 Jebong-ro, Dong-gu, Gwangju, 61469, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Chonnam National University Medical School and Hospital, 42 Jebong-ro, Dong-gu, Gwangju, 61469, Republic of Korea. opheye@hanmail.net.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Ophthalmol,BMC ophthalmology,100967802,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation', 'Asthenopia', 'Convergence', 'Virtual reality']",,2020/05/26 06:00,2020/05/26 06:00,['2020/05/26 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12886-020-01471-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12886-020-01471-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Ophthalmol. 2020 May 24;20(1):200. doi: 10.1186/s12886-020-01471-4.,,20200524,,,,,PMC7245896,"['NRF- 2017R1D1A3B03032579/Basic Science Research Program through the National', 'Research Foundation of Korea', 'CRI 17031-1/Chonnam National University Hospital Biomedical Research Institute']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2169-8770'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its unique molecular structure, astaxanthin features some important biologic properties, mostly represented by strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic activities. A growing body of evidence suggests that astaxanthin is efficacious in the prevention and treatment of several ocular diseases, ranging from the anterior to the posterior pole of the eye. Therefore, the present review aimed at providing a comprehensive evaluation of current clinical applications of astaxanthin in the management of ocular diseases. The efficacy of this carotenoid in the setting of retinal diseases, ocular surface disorders, uveitis, cataract and asthenopia is reported in numerous animal and human studies, which highlight its ability of modulating several metabolic pathways, subsequently restoring the cellular homeostatic balance. To maximize its multitarget therapeutic effects, further long-term clinical trials are warranted in order to define appropriate dosage, route of administration and exact composition of the final product.","['Giannaccare, Giuseppe', 'Pellegrini, Marco', 'Senni, Carlotta', 'Bernabei, Federico', 'Scorcia, Vincenzo', 'Cicero, Arrigo Francesco Giuseppe']","['Giannaccare G', 'Pellegrini M', 'Senni C', 'Bernabei F', 'Scorcia V', 'Cicero AFG']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Ophthalmology Unit, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Ophthalmology Unit, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Ophthalmology Unit, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Medical and Surgical Sciences Department, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['age-related macular degeneration', 'astaxanthin', 'carotenoids', 'cataract', 'dry eye disease', 'eye', 'glaucoma', 'nutritional supplements', 'oxidative stress']",,2020/05/07 06:00,2020/05/07 06:00,['2020/05/07 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['md18050239 [pii]', '10.3390/md18050239 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2020 May 1;18(5). pii: md18050239. doi: 10.3390/md18050239.,,20200501,,,,,PMC7281326,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2617-0289', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6419-6941', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4367-3884']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of manipulating the capacity to focus on task-relevant stimuli, using two levels of dual-tasking (arithmetic task) and auditory feedback, on the accommodative dynamics at three different target distances (500, 40 and 20 cm). METHODS: The magnitude and variability of the accommodative response were objectively measured in 20 healthy young adults using the Grand Seiko WAM-5500 autorefractor. In randomised order, participants fixated on a Maltese cross while 1) performing an arithmetic task with two levels of complexity (low and high mental load); 2) being provided with two levels of auditory feedback (low and high feedback); and 3) without performing any mental task or receiving feedback (control). Accommodative and pupil dynamics were monitored for 90 seconds during each of the 15 trials (5 experimental conditions x 3 target distances). RESULTS: The lag of accommodation was sensitive to the attentional state (p = 0.001), where a lower lag of accommodation was observed for the high feedback condition compared to the control (corrected p-value = 0.009). The imposition of mental load while fixating on a distant target led to a greater accommodative response (corrected p-value = 0.010), but no effects were found for the near targets. There was a main effect of the experimental manipulation on the accommodative variability (p < 0.001), with the use of auditory feedback improving the accuracy of the accommodative system. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that accommodative dynamics is affected by varying the capacity to focus on task-relevant stimuli, observing an improvement in accommodative stability and response with auditory feedback. These results highlight an association between attention and ocular dynamics and provide new insight into the control of accommodation.","['Redondo, Beatriz', 'Vera, Jesus', 'Molina, Ruben', 'Davies, Leon N', 'Jimenez, Raimundo']","['Redondo B', 'Vera J', 'Molina R', 'Davies LN', 'Jimenez R']","['Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'School of Optometry, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*accommodation', '*asthenopia', '*myopia']",,2020/05/06 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2020/05/06 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/opo.12690 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2020 Jul;40(4):510-518. doi: 10.1111/opo.12690.

Prolonged accommodative effort has been associated with an increased risk of strabismus. Strabismus may result in asthenopia and intermittent diplopia, and makes near work tasks difficult to complete. Spectacles to correct hyperopic refractive error is believed to prevent the development of strabismus. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of prescription spectacles compared with no intervention for the prevention of strabismus in infants and children with hyperopia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2018, Issue 12; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; three other databases; and two trial registries. We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 4 December 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials investigating spectacle intervention or no treatment for children with hyperopia. We required hyperopia to be at least greater than +2.00 diopters (D). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with manifest strabismus, as defined by study investigators. Other outcomes included the amblyopia, stereoacuity, and the effect of spectacle use of strabismus and visual acuity. We also collected information on change in refractive error as a measurement of the interference of emmetropization. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four randomized controlled trials (985 children enrolled who were aged six months to less than 36 months) in this review. Three trials were in the UK with follow-up periods ranging from one to 3.5 years and one in the US with three years' follow-up. Investigators reported both incidence and final status regarding strabismus. Evidence of the incidence of strabismus, measured in 804 children over three to four years in four trials was uncertain although suggestive of a benefit with spectacle use (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.02). We have very low confidence in these results due to high risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. When assessed as the proportion of children with strabismus at the end of three years' follow-up, we found a similar level of evidence for an effect of spectacles on strabismus as reported in one study (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.25; 106 children). We have very low confidence in these results because of low sample size and risk of bias. One trial reported on the risk for developing amblyopia and inadequate stereoacuity after three years in 106 children. There was unclear evidence for a decreased risk of developing amblyopia (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.93), and limited evidence for a benefit of spectacles for prevention of inadequate stereoacuity (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.88). We have very low confidence in these findings due to imprecision and risk of bias. The risk of not developing emmetropization is unclear. One trial reported on the proportion of children not achieving emmetropization at three years' follow-up (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.19). One trial suggested spectacles impede emmetropization, and one trial reported no difference. These two trials could not be combined because the methods for assessing emmetropization were different. With the high risk of bias and inconsistency, the certainty of evidence for a risk for impeding or benefiting emmetropization is very low. Based on a meta-analysis of four trials (770 children), the risk of having visual acuity worse than 20/30 measured up to three years of age or at the end of three years of follow-up was uncertain for children with spectacle correction compared with those without correction (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.18; very low confidence due to risk of bias and imprecision). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effect of spectacle correction for prevention of strabismus is still unclear. In addition, the use of spectacle on the risk of visual acuity worse than 20/30, amblyopia, and inadequate emmetropization is also unclear. There may be a benefit on prevention of inadequate stereoacuity.

This study was compliant with the accordance with CONSORT 2010 statement. A total of 109 healthy adult men and women aged 20-60 years were recruited and randomized into SBE and placebo groups. The subjects in the SBE and placebo groups were administered 240 mg of SBE and placebo, respectively, once daily for 12 weeks. Tests were performed before and after VDT tasks at week 0, 4, 8, and 12; high-frequency component (HFC)-1 value was the evaluation outcome. Results showed that post-load HFC-1 values at weeks 8 and 12 were significantly improved in the SBE group than in the placebo group (p = 0.014 and 0.017, respectively). Regarding the difference between before and after the task load (DeltaHFC-1), the values were significantly better in the SBE group than in the placebo group at week 4 and 12 (p = 0.018 and 0.049, respectively). This study shows that oral consumption of 240 mg SBE extract for 12 weeks relieves the tonic accommodation of the ciliary muscle caused by VDT tasks and near-vision tasks.","['Kosehira, Marie', 'Machida, Naomichi', 'Kitaichi, Nobuyoshi']","['Kosehira M', 'Machida N', 'Kitaichi N']","['Research Department, Omnica Co., Ltd, 4-21-7 Itabashi, Itabashi ward, Tokyo, 173-0004, Japan.', 'Research Department, Omnica Co., Ltd, 4-21-7 Itabashi, Itabashi ward, Tokyo, 173-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, Sapporo 002-8072, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation', 'accommodative microfluctuation', 'asthenopia', 'bilberry', 'clinical trial', 'refraction']","['M.K. and N.M. are employees of Omnica Co., Ltd., Japan.']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12030600 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12030600 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 Feb 25;12(3). pii: nu12030600. doi: 10.3390/nu12030600.,,20200225,,,,,PMC7146147,"['OM-B1604/Omnica Co., Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, the need for near and intermediate visual tasks has been dramatically increased, requiring prolonged computer- and gazette-related works. It demands excessive working of the extraocular and ciliary muscles. It may cause eye fatigue and other associated asthenopic symptoms. Globally, eye fatigue is one of the most commonly reported conditions in nonpresbyopic population with asthenopic symptoms. It is necessary to get relief from eye fatigue for better near and intermediate tasks. Materials and Methods: Thirty-two undergraduate optometry students who were symptomatic based on a validated eye fatigue questionnaire were included after a baseline comprehensive eye examination. Based on the eye fatigue symptoms score, they were equally assigned to a control group and an exercise group with sixteen participants in each. The exercise group performed yoga ocular exercises for up to 6 weeks after which the eye fatigue symptoms were reassessed in both groups. Results: In the exercise group, there was a statistically significant reduction in eye fatigue scores (P = 0.003), whereas the eye fatigue scores showed significant increment in the control group after 6 weeks (P = 0.044). Conclusions: Yoga ocular exercises reduce the eye fatigue symptoms score by increasing the efficiency of extraocular muscles. Hence, it could be considered as a therapeutic and nonpharmacologic intervention for reducing the eye fatigue and associated asthenopic symptoms.","['Gupta, Satish Kumar', 'Aparna, S']","['Gupta SK', 'Aparna S']","['Department of Optometry, Sankara Academy of Vision, Sankara College of Optometry, Sankara Eye Hospital, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Optometry, Sankara Academy of Vision, Sankara College of Optometry, Sankara Eye Hospital, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Int J Yoga,International journal of yoga,101313247,,['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'eye fatigue', 'vergence', 'yoga ocular exercises']",['There are no conflicts of interest.'],2020/02/08 06:00,2020/02/08 06:01,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/ijoy.IJOY_26_19 [doi]', 'IJY-13-76 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Yoga. 2020 Jan-Apr;13(1):76-79. doi: 10.4103/ijoy.IJOY_26_19.,['Copyright: (c) 2019 International Journal of Yoga.'],,,,,,PMC6937872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is limited evidence to support the proposal that DES results from the blue light emitted by electronic screens. OBJECTIVE: This investigation compared the effect of blue-blocking filters on DES symptoms with a no-filter lens, using a double-blind methodology. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects were required to perform a 20-minute reading task from a tablet computer. They wore either lenses containing a blue-blocking filter (TheraBlue 1.67 or TheraBlue polycarbonate) or a CR-39 control lens which did not include a filter. Immediately following each session, subjects completed a questionnaire to quantify symptoms of DES. RESULTS: While a significant increase in symptoms was observed immediately following the near vision task (p = 0.00001), no significant difference in symptoms was found between the 3 lens conditions (p = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence at this time to support the use of blue-blocking filters as a clinical treatment for DES. Management of other ocular factors, as well as the creation of an optimal environment for screen viewing, are more likely to provide greater success in minimizing symptoms.","['Rosenfield, Mark', 'Li, Rui Ting', 'Kirsch, Nancy T']","['Rosenfield M', 'Li RT', 'Kirsch NT']","['SUNY College of Optometry, New York, NY, USA.', 'SUNY College of Optometry, New York, NY, USA.', 'SUNY College of Optometry, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Blue-blocking filter', 'blue light', 'computer vision syndrome', 'digital eye strain', 'visual symptoms']",,2020/02/03 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2020/02/03 06:00'],"['2020/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['WOR203086 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-203086 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2020;65(2):343-348. doi: 10.3233/WOR-203086.,,,20200922,,,"['Adolescent', 'Asthenopia/*prevention & control', 'Color', 'Computers, Handheld', 'Double-Blind Method', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Filtration/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reading', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tried to fill the gap by utilizing two novel eye-tracking parameters, i.e., the fixation frequency (FF) and saccade amplitude (SA), along with traditional indicators (i.e., the eye blink frequency (BF) and subjective score (SS)) of visual fatigue in two eye-tracking tests, i.e., the random digit search and fixed-point gaze. Twenty healthy subjects participated in the experiment during the same period of two consecutive days. A visual stimulus program was presented to each subject before the subjective grading and eye-tracking tests, followed by the relief of eyes with either using a FIR thermal eye mask or physically closing eyes. Finally, subjective grading and eye-tracking tests were re-performed. Results showed that FF and SA, along with BF and SS, were significantly different when measured before and after the eye relief with FIR therapy mask, suggesting that FF and SA were useful in evaluating visual fatigue. In addition, FIR therapy yielded much better performance than eye-closing rest, indicating that FIR therapy had the potential in accelerating the relief of visual fatigue.","['Feng, Yong', 'Wang, Lei', 'Chen, Fei']","['Feng Y', 'Wang L', 'Chen F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

This study was designed to determine the stereo acuity levels among college students and compare it with the hours of use of digital technology. Methods: University students in the age group of 18-25 years were screened for visual acuity for distance and near. Refraction was done to find the presence of refractive errors. Those students who had no vergence or accommodation dysfunction and orthophoria were only included in the study. Stereopsis was assessed using random dot stereo acuity chart. The stereo acuity results were grouped as either normal (20 arc seconds or better), Borderline (25 arc seconds to 40 arc seconds) and reduced stereopsis (50 arc seconds to 400 arc seconds). Students were also questioned about the hours of use of digital media. Results: The average age of the 246 participates was 20 +/- 1.9 years with 78 (32%) were males and 168 (68%) were females. 7% of the population was found to be myopic in our study. The hours of use of digital technology ranged from 0-9 hours a day. Only 13.1% of the student's population met the normal level of stereopsis (20 arc seconds). Around 44.3% of the study population was found to have borderline stereopsis. Also 42.6% of the study population, reduced stereopsis was found. Among the reduced stereo acuity levels, we found stereoacuity levels as low as 100-200 arc seconds were found in nearly 17.6% of the study population. Conclusion: It is very much evident from this study that a large group of college students are not enjoying the highest level of binocular vision, which in turn can have a negative impact on their academic performance.","['Deepa, B M S', 'Valarmathi, A', 'Benita, Sharon']","['Deepa BMS', 'Valarmathi A', 'Benita S']","['Department of Optometry, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (Deemed to be University), Porur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Optometry, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (Deemed to be University), Porur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Optometry, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (Deemed to be University), Porur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Family Med Prim Care,Journal of family medicine and primary care,101610082,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'binocular vision', 'digital technology', 'randot stereo acuity test chart', 'stereo acuity']",['There is no conflict of interest.'],2019/12/28 06:00,2019/12/28 06:01,['2019/12/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_755_19 [doi]', 'JFMPC-8-3850 [pii]']",epublish,J Family Med Prim Care. 2019 Dec 10;8(12):3850-3853. doi: 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_755_19. eCollection 2019 Dec.,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.'],20191210,,,,,PMC6924232,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, participants were selected using multistage cluster sampling. Presence of at least one of the 10 symptoms-foreign body sensation, diplopia, blurred vision, eye swelling, dry eye, eye pain, difficulty in sustaining visual operations, decreased visual acuity, tearing, and photophobia-was considered as asthenopia. Ocular examinations, including uncorrected/corrected visual acuity measurement, objective/subjective refraction, cover test, amplitude of accommodation (AA), and near point of convergence (NPC) were performed. Results: Of the 1,462 students (mean age: 22.8 +/- 3.1 years), 73% were women. The age- and gender-standardized prevalence was 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68.3-73.5), 39.8% (95% CI: 36.4-43.1), and 19.7% (95% CI: 16.0-23.3) based on the presence of at least one, two, and three symptoms, respectively. The prevalence was significantly higher in females (P = 0.048), hyperopic students (P < 0.001), and astigmatic participants (P < 0.001).

Multiple regression model revealed age (28-29 years), astigmatism, and NPC as independent associated factors (odds ratios: 3.51, 1.61, and 0.91, respectively). Conclusion: This study shows relatively high prevalence of asthenopia in university students. Demographic factors and visual system disorders are important risk factors and timely correction of conditions may lead to decreased asthenopia.","['Hashemi, Hassan', 'Saatchi, Mohammad', 'Yekta, Abbasali', 'Ali, Babak', 'Ostadimoghaddam, Hadi', 'Nabovati, Payam', 'Aghamirsalim, Mohamadreza', 'Khabazkhoob, Mehdi']","['Hashemi H', 'Saatchi M', 'Yekta A', 'Ali B', 'Ostadimoghaddam H', 'Nabovati P', 'Aghamirsalim M', 'Khabazkhoob M']","['Noor Research Center for Ophthalmic Epidemiology, Noor Eye Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Noor Ophthalmology Research Center, Noor Eye Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Noor Research Center for Ophthalmic Epidemiology, Noor Eye Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Optometry, School of Paramedical Sciences, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Optometry, School of Paramedical Sciences, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Refractive Errors Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Rehabilitation Research Center, Department of Optometry, School of Rehabilitation Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Eye Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Psychiatric Nursing and Management, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",India,J Ophthalmic Vis Res,Journal of ophthalmic & vision research,101497643,,['NOTNLM'],"['Astigmatism', 'Photophobia', 'Prevalence', 'Asthenopia']",['There is no conflict of interest.'],2019/12/26 06:00,2019/12/26 06:01,['2019/12/26 06:00'],"['2017/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.18502/jovr.v14i4.5455 [doi]'],epublish,J Ophthalmic Vis Res. 2019 Oct 24;14(4):474-482. doi: 10.18502/jovr.v14i4.5455. eCollection 2019 Oct-Dec.,['Copyright (c) 2019 Hashemi et al.'],20191024,,,,,PMC6825687,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2109-0856', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4356-9064']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After applying exclusion criteria, statistical analyses were performed on the data of 726 individuals. All participants underwent optometric tests including measurement of visual acuity, objective and subjective refraction, as well as binocular vision and ocular health examinations. The unilateral and alternate cover tests were done to detect the tropia and phoria at 6 m and 40 cm, respectively.Results: The overall prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of tropia, exotropia, and esotropia were 1.5% (0.8 to 2.7), 1.2% (0.6 to 2.4), and 0.3% (0.1 to 1.1), respectively. The prevalence of esotropia was significantly higher in older age groups (24 years old) (p = .040) . The prevalence of exotropia was significantly higher in females (0.039) and in myopic individuals (p = .001). The overall prevalence and 95% CI of phoria, exophoria, and esophoria were 12.9% (10.7 to 15.6), 11.7% (9.6 to 14.3), and 1.2% (0.6 to 2.3), respectively. There was a significant difference in the overall prevalence of exophoria according to the age (0.021). The prevalence of esophoria was significantly higher in females (p = .039). The prevalence of exophoria was significantly higher in myopic participants (p = .003). Exophoria and exotropia were the most common types of phoria and tropia, respectively.Conclusion: The prevalence of strabismus in university students was similar to the Iranian general population but lower than other countries. One in every 10 students had phoria, which was much lower than similar reports on Iranian populations; however, due to near-work activity, these students are prone to asthenopia, early visual fatigue, and decreased productivity. Therefore, it is suggested that university students also undergo screening programs to detect the cases of tropia and phoria.","['Hashemi, Hassan', 'Pakzad, Reza', 'Nabovati, Payam', 'Azad Shahraki, Fatemeh', 'Ostadimoghaddam, Hadi', 'Aghamirsalim, Mohamadreza', 'Pakbin, Mojgan', 'Yekta, Abbasali', 'Khoshhal, Fahimeh', 'Khabazkhoob, Mehdi']","['Hashemi H', 'Pakzad R', 'Nabovati P', 'Azad Shahraki F', 'Ostadimoghaddam H', 'Aghamirsalim M', 'Pakbin M', 'Yekta A', 'Khoshhal F', 'Khabazkhoob M']","['Noor Research Center for Ophthalmic Epidemiology, Noor Eye Hospital, Tehran.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Health, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam.', 'Rehabilitation Research Center, Department of Optometry, School of Rehabilitation Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran.', 'Department of Optometry, School of Paramedical Sciences, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad.', 'Refractive Errors Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad.', 'Eye Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran.', 'Noor Ophthalmology Research Center, Noor Eye Hospital, Tehran.', 'Department of Optometry, School of Paramedical Sciences, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dezful University of Medical Sciences, Dezful.', 'Department of Psychiatric Nursing and Management, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Strabismus,Strabismus,9310896,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cross-sectional study', '*Iran', '*Phoria', '*Strabismus', '*Tropia']",,2019/12/24 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/12/24 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09273972.2019.1697300 [doi]'],ppublish,Strabismus. 2020 Mar;28(1):35-41. doi: 10.1080/09273972.2019.1697300.

Objective To quantify changes in the ocular surface and tear film in dry cleaners exposed to organic solvents and associate these changes with ocular irritation as reported in a symptom questionnaire for dry eye diagnosis. Methods This was a case and control study in which the characteristics and eye-irritation symptoms were compared between two groups of 62 participants that were either exposed or not exposed to organic solvents. A general optometric examination and the following test were performed: lipid interferometry, Lissamine Green Stain, tear breakup time, Schirmer I, conjunctival impression cytology and the Donate dry eye symptoms questionnaire. Results Sixty-five percent of exposed workers obtained a higher score than 13 on the Donate dry eye symptoms questionnaire which indicated the presence of more irritation symptoms than those in the non- exposed group. A Chi-square analysis indicated the exposed group reported significantly higher incidences (P <0.005) for eye irritation symptoms of sandy sensation; tearing eyes sensation; foreign body sensation; tearing; dry eye; dryness; eyestrain and heavy eyelids. A Mann Whitney-U indicated greater severity only for symptoms relating to dry eye; sandy sensation; foreign body sensation, tearing; tearing eyes and dryness. There was a statistically significant difference (P <0.05) for Schirmer I; tear break up time; and the ocular surface assessed with Lissamine green staining and conjunctival impression cytology between groups. A reduction in the thickness of the lipid layer in the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group was observed. Surprisingly, clinical test outcomes were not significantly correlated with dry eye symptoms nor years of exposure. Conclusion Workers in the dry-cleaning industry exposed to organic solvents are associated with changes in ocular surface and tear film generating irritation symptoms commonly present in evaporative dry eye.","['Jimenez Barbosa, Ingrid Astrid', 'Rodriguez Alvarez, Martha Fabiola', 'Dussan Torres, Gerardo Andres', 'Khuu, Sieu K']","['Jimenez Barbosa IA', 'Rodriguez Alvarez MF', 'Dussan Torres GA', 'Khuu SK']","['Health and Sciences Faculty, Optometry Program, University of La Salle, Bogota, Colombia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'Health and Sciences Faculty, Optometry Program, University of La Salle, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Health and Sciences Faculty, Optometry Program, University of La Salle, Bogota, Colombia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/12/10 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0226042 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-12808 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Dec 9;14(12):e0226042. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0226042. eCollection 2019.,,20191209,20200406,"['0 (Lipids)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Solvents)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Conjunctiva/*drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Eyelids/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laundering', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Organic Chemicals/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Solvents/*chemistry', 'Tears/chemistry/*drug effects/physiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6901226,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7874-2598'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old female university student with myopic anisometropia presented for an OK lens fitting consultation. At baseline, perceptual interocular image size difference or aniseikonia of 1.45% was found, with a smaller image seen by the right eye compared to the left eye. The patient was fitted with a pair of OK lenses and interocular image size differences, subjective refraction and corneal topography were measured after 7, 14 and 47 days of overnight lens wear. Hyperopic shifts in central refraction and corresponding flattening of the central cornea was measured during OK treatment. Aniseikonia reduced after OK wear with the most significant change measured from baseline to day 7. Aniseikonia recorded after 7, 14 and 47 nights of lens wear was 0.05%, 0.35% and 0.85%, respectively. Although minimum differences in refractive error between eyes was reached after 47 days of OK, aniseikonia was greater than that measured after 7 and 14 days of OK. CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates reduction in aniseikonia with OK lens wear in a myopic patient with axial anisometropia, although this effect was not sustained beyond 1 week of lens wear. As the impact of corneal curvature changes on aniseikonia is not well understood, future studies on the impact of OK on aniseikonia and associated asthenopia is required.","['Kwan, Singson Chi Keong', 'Khuu, Sieu K', 'Kang, Pauline']","['Kwan SCK', 'Khuu SK', 'Kang P']","['Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore; School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of New South Wales, Australia.

However, in addition to visually induced motion sickness (VIMS), eye fatigue has increasingly emerged during and after the viewing experience, highlighting the necessity of quantitatively assessment of the detrimental effects. As no measurement method for the eye fatigue caused by HMDs has been widely accepted, we detected parameters related to optometry test. We proposed a novel computational approach for estimation of eye fatigue by providing various verifiable models. RESULTS: We implemented three classifications and two regressions to investigate different feature sets, which led to present two valid assessment models for eye fatigue by employing blinking features and eye movement features with the ground truth of indicators for optometry test. Three graded results and one continuous result were provided by each model, respectively, which caused the whole result to be repeatable and comparable. CONCLUSION: We showed differences between VIMS and eye fatigue, and we also presented a new scheme to assess eye fatigue of HMDs users by analysis of parameters of the eye tracker.","['Wang, Yan', 'Zhai, Guangtao', 'Chen, Sichao', 'Min, Xiongkuo', 'Gao, Zhongpai', 'Song, Xuefei']","['Wang Y', 'Zhai G', 'Chen S', 'Min X', 'Gao Z', 'Song X']","['Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing and Transmissions, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. yanwang@sjtu.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing and Transmissions, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Ophthalmology and Vision Science of Beijing, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing and Transmissions, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing and Transmissions, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orbital Diseases and Ocular Oncology, Shanghai, China.', 'Clinical Research Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biomed Eng Online,Biomedical engineering online,101147518,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation response', 'Eye fatigue', 'Eye movement', 'Head-mounted display']",,2019/11/16 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12938-019-0731-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12938-019-0731-5 [pii]']",epublish,Biomed Eng Online. 2019 Nov 15;18(1):111. doi: 10.1186/s12938-019-0731-5.,,20191115,20200407,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/physiopathology', '*Eye Movements', 'Female', '*Head', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",PMC6858717,"['61331014/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '61521062/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'DLY201615/Multi-Centered Clinical Research Foundation']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0733-3812'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Ten IXT patients and ten healthy subjects wearing full-correction lenses at far sight (5 m) were instructed to fixate on a near target at 67 cm, which was then moved to 40 cm three times. Serial changes in the spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error (SE) were measured during this task using a laboratory-made open-field binocular Hartmann-Shack wavefront aberrometer and compared between patients and healthy subjects. In the IXT patients, regression analysis was performed between SE and exodeviation angles, as measured by an alternate prism and cover test. Pupil-diameter and pupil-constriction ratios were also compared between patients and healthy subjects, and the correlation of constriction ratio with SE was calculated for both groups. RESULTS: Compared to healthy subjects, IXT patients demonstrated significantly lower SE of convergence (mean +/- SD, 0.91 +/- 0.26 D vs. 1.15 +/- 0.19 D; P < 0.05) and divergence (0.93 +/- 0.28 D vs. 1.16 +/- 0.20 D; P < 0.05). Angle of exotropia was negatively correlated with SE during far-sight and near-sight convergence and divergence (P < 0.05). Pupil-constriction ratio was also reduced in patients compared to healthy subjects (6.67% +/- 3.31% vs. 11.9% +/- 5.96%; P<0.05). Pupil-constriction ratio was positively correlated with SE during convergence in both groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Insufficient accommodation and pupil constriction during near viewing were observed in patients with IXT who had complaints of blurred vision or asthenopia from near viewing. These conditions might contribute to symptoms, such as fatigue, eye strain and impaired visual performance.","['Morimoto, Takeshi', 'Kanda, Hiroyuki', 'Hirota, Masakazu', 'Nishida, Kohji', 'Fujikado, Takashi']","['Morimoto T', 'Kanda H', 'Hirota M', 'Nishida K', 'Fujikado T']","['Department of Applied Visual Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan. takeshi.morimoto@ophthal.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Applied Visual Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Visual Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Visual Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Ophthalmol,Japanese journal of ophthalmology,0044652,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation', 'Binocular vision', 'Exotropia', 'Eye fatigue', 'Pupil constriction']",,2019/11/11 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2019/11/11 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10384-019-00695-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10384-019-00695-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Jpn J Ophthalmol. 2020 Jan;64(1):77-85. doi: 10.1007/s10384-019-00695-2.

(4)The median (IQR) of near point of convergence (NPC) became significantly larger [before: 3.9 (2.6), 4.0 (2.5), 4.3 (2.7) cm; after 5.4 (3.8), 4.8 (2.7), 6.1 (3.9) cm; Z=-3.39, -2.27, -3.36; all P<0.05]. (5)The median of negative relative accommodation (NRA) reduced significantly [before: 2.00 (0.50), 2.00 (0.56), 2.00 (0.25) cm; after 1.75 (0.50), 1.75 (0.25), 1.75 (0.50) cm; Z=-1.98, -2.09, -2.53; all P<0.05]. Meanwhile, no significant changes were found for the positive relative accommodation (PRA), accommodative amplitude, accommodative response, negative relative vergence in all groups after watching the video. The comparisons between the three groups showed that, after watching the video, the participants in the two kinds of projection screen group (the metal and glass bead screen group) had more subjective visual fatigue than those in the flat screen group respectively (Z=-2.09, -2.21; all P<0.05), while there was no significant difference in subjective visual fatigue between the two projection screen groups (P>0.05). In addition, positive fusional vergence recovery point and break point decreased after watching the video in the metal screen and glass bead screen group, respectively (t=4.15, 2.07; all P<0.05). However, no such change was found in the flat screen group. Conclusions: Short-term and long-distance VDT operations have significant effects on visual fatigue, which may be due to the decreased positive convergence ability. VDT operations over projection screens may result in more visual fatigue than LED flat panel display, while the effect of different projection screen types have insignificant influences on visual fatigue.

Many studies have investigated the effects of VAC using 3D displays and expensive complex apparatus and setup to create natural and conflicting viewing conditions. However, a limited number of studies targeted virtual environments simulated using modern consumer-grade VR headsets. Our main objective, in this work, is to test how the modern VR headsets (VR simulated depth) could affect our vergence system, in addition to investigating the effect of the simulated depth on the eye-gaze performance. The virtual scenario used included a common virtual object (a cube) in a simple virtual environment with no constraints placed on the head and neck movement of the subjects. We used ocular biomechanics and eye tracking to compare between vergence angles in matching (ideal) and conflicting (real) viewing conditions. Real vergence angle during immersion was significantly higher than ideal vergence angle and exhibited higher variability which leads to incorrect depth cues that affects depth perception and also leads to visual fatigue for prolonged virtual experiences. Additionally, we found that as the simulated depth increases, the ability of users to manipulate virtual objects with their eyes decreases, thus, decreasing the possibilities of interaction through eye gaze. The biomechanics model used here can be further extended to study muscular activity of eye muscles during immersion. It presents an efficient and flexible assessment tool for virtual environments.","['Iskander, Julie', 'Hossny, Mohammed', 'Nahavandi, Saeid']","['Iskander J', 'Hossny M', 'Nahavandi S']","['Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation (IISRI), Deakin University, Australia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 56 schoolchildren with functional visual impairments aged 8-17 years, among which 7 had spasm of accommodation, and 49 - paralysis or paresis of accommodation. The examination included visometry, refractometry, ophthalmometry, measurement of the axial eye length, absolute and relative accommodation parameters, fusional reserves, as well as character of binocular vision and asthenopic complaints. RESULTS: The patients with spasms, pareses and paralyses of accommodation were revealed to have decreased visual acuity, absence or sharp decrease in absolute and relative accommodation, fusional reserves, and simultaneous vision. A method for treating such patients has been developed, which aims for improvement of the blood supply to the ciliary muscle, accommodation reflex, visual acuity and differential sensitivity of the retina, vergence and version accommodation tonicity, convergence and fusion ability. The treatment led to normalization of absolute and relative accommodation, and increase of fusional reserves. The character of vision became binocular, asthenopic complaints stopped. The 'anlauf' glasses allow long-term preservation of the effect of received treatment, as well as prevention of visual disturbances in eye-straining work. CONCLUSION: The complex approach to the treatment of patients with spasms, pareses and paralyses of accommodation leads to restoration of the functions of visual analyzer in fairly short time (15-20 sessions).","['Kornyushina, T A']",['Kornyushina TA'],"['S.

Ten specific symptoms were evaluated each with a subjective score and total score was applied to grade the severity of MGD. Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with mild, 19 with moderate, and 7 with severe MGD. Slit-lamp and keratography were used to assess the signs of ocular surface and meibomian gland (MG). In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed to evaluate the corneal nerves and dendritic cells. The differences and correlations between symptoms, signs, and IVCM parameters were analyzed.Dryness, foreign body sensation, asthenopia, and photophobia were the most common and severe symptoms in our patients. The severe MGD group showed worse MG expressibility, Meibum score, Meiboscore, MG score, and higher nerve reflectivity (P < .05). The mild MGD group showed higher nerve density (P < .05). Total symptom score was negatively correlated with nerve density (r = -0.374, P < .05), while positively correlated with nerve reflectivity and dendritic cell density (r = 0.332 and 0.288, respectively, P < .05). MG score was correlated with nerve reflectivity (r = 0.265, P < .05).The comprehensive grading scale was suitable for evaluating clinical manifestations in MGD of varying severity. The relationship between the specific symptoms, signs, and IVCM results concerning whole ocular surface impairment could help elucidate MGD pathophysiology and benefit evaluation or treatment in the future.","['Fu, Jiayu', 'Chou, Yilin', 'Hao, Ran', 'Jiang, Xiaodan', 'Liu, Yushi', 'Li, Xuemin']","['Fu J', 'Chou Y', 'Hao R', 'Jiang X', 'Liu Y', 'Li X']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, P.R.

However, most SSVEP-based BCI studies performed in VR environments have adopted visual stimuli that are typically used in conventional LCD environments without considering the differences in the rendering devices (head-mounted displays (HMDs) used in the VR environments). The proximity between the visual stimuli and the eyes in HMDs can readily cause eyestrain, degrading the overall performance of SSVEP-based BCIs. Therefore, in the present study, we have tested two different types of visual stimuli-pattern-reversal checkerboard stimulus (PRCS) and grow/shrink stimulus (GSS)-on young healthy participants wearing HMDs. Preliminary experiments were conducted to investigate the visual comfort of each participant during the presentation of the visual stimuli. In subsequent online avatar control experiments, we observed considerable differences in the classification accuracy of individual participants based on the type of visual stimuli used to elicit SSVEP. Interestingly, there was a close relationship between the subjective visual comfort score and the online performance of the SSVEP-based BCI: most participants showed better classification accuracy under visual stimulus they were more comfortable with. Our experimental results suggest the importance of an appropriate visual stimulus to enhance the overall performance of the SSVEP-based BCIs in VR environments. In addition, it is expected that the appropriate visual stimulus for a certain user might be readily selected by surveying the user's visual comfort for different visual stimuli, without the need for the actual BCI experiments.","['Choi, Kang-Min', 'Park, Seonghun', 'Im, Chang-Hwan']","['Choi KM', 'Park S', 'Im CH']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Comput Intell Neurosci,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,101279357,IM,,,,2019/07/30 06:00,2020/01/17 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/9680697 [doi]'],epublish,Comput Intell Neurosci. 2019 Jul 1;2019:9680697. doi: 10.1155/2019/9680697. eCollection 2019.,,20190701,20200116,,,"['Asthenopia/etiology/prevention & control', 'Brain/physiology', '*Brain-Computer Interfaces', '*Evoked Potentials, Visual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Photic Stimulation/methods', '*Virtual Reality', 'Visual Perception/physiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6636533,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1968-3641', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8676-1286', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3795-3318']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results are discussed relative to their possible implications for myopia progression and visual fatigue. PURPOSE: The accommodative response has been investigated owing to its possible relationship with the onset and progression of myopia and visual fatigue. This study explored the influence of wearing soft contact lenses in comparison with spectacles in terms of magnitude and variability of accommodation. In addition, we analyzed the intersession and intermethod repeatability. METHODS: Dynamic accommodative response was recorded during 30-second epochs, at five different distances (50, 40, 33, 25, and 20 cm), in 21 individuals (mean refractive error +/- SD, -0.79 +/- 1.39 D) while wearing either soft contact lenses or spectacles on two different days. To assess repeatability, a second identical intervention was conducted. RESULTS: Higher lags of accommodation were obtained with the use of soft contact lenses in comparison with the spectacle condition (P = .04, partial eta [etap] = 0.204), and similarly, a higher variability of accommodation at near distances was found during the soft contact lens measurement (P < .001, etap = 0.647). There was a strong intersession repeatability at all the distances tested for both optical correction methods. CONCLUSIONS: The higher accommodative lag and fluctuations found while wearing soft contact lenses in comparison with spectacles may help to understand the mechanisms underlying myopia progression and asthenopia. These findings may be also considered when testing the accommodative response in research settings. Our test-retest design confirmed that there is a very good intersession repeatability for all the distances in both optical correction methods.","['Jimenez, Raimundo', 'Redondo, Beatriz', 'Davies, Leon N', 'Vera, Jesus']","['Jimenez R', 'Redondo B', 'Davies LN', 'Vera J']","['Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Ophthalmic Research Group, School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2019/07/26 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2019/07/26 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/OPX.0000000000001406 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2019 Aug;96(8):568-578. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0000000000001406.,,,20200221,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/physiopathology', '*Contact Lenses, Hydrophilic', 'Disease Progression', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myopia, Degenerative/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Vision Tests', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology', 'Visual Acuity/physiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the consequence of passive mechanisms due to the anatomy of the globes and orbits or due to active innervational mechanisms, resulting in divergence of the visual axes, which is compensated by fusional convergence. Intermittent insufficiency in this compensation gives this form of exotropia its intermittent nature. The most common symptoms of IXT are closure of one eye, asthenopia and diplopia, but they are often absent. The clinical classification of IXT (according to Burian) is based on the difference between the distant and the near angles of deviation. It defines 4 types: true divergence excess (at distance), pseudo-divergence excess, the basic form (distance and near angles are equal) and convergence insufficiency (near angle greater than distance angle). One of the main difficulties in examination of IXT is neutralizing the fusional convergence in order to classify the strabismus. For this purpose, the monocular occlusion test, a near addition, or a prism adaptation test can be used. IXT is also characterised by the quality of control of the deviation by the patient, which is taken in account for therapeutic decision. Tools for measurement of this control have recently been developed and are not commonly used. The natural history of IXT is not well understood. Treatment relies mainly on optical correction, binocular visual training therapy and surgery, but their indications are not well defined, nor are outcomes analysis criteria. In the case of surgery, it aims to treat the maximum measured distance angle; the medium- and long-term angular results of surgery are often disappointing, although it probably improves control of the strabismus in most cases.","['Audren, F']",['Audren F'],"['Fondation ophtalmologique Adolphe-de-Rothschild, 25, rue Manin, 75019 Paris, France.

METHODS: A total of 88 patients with dry eye syndrome of deficiency lacrima production were randomized into an acupoint thread-embedding therapy group (thread-embedding group) and a control group with topical artificial tears eye drops (medication group), 44 cases in each one. In the thread-embedding group, 3 cases were dropped out. In the thread-embedding group, Ganshu (BL 18), Pishu (BL 20) and Shenshu (BL 23) etc. were selected and the acupoint thread-embedding therapy was operated once every 30 days, totally for two treatments. In the medication group, the topical artificial tears eye drops was used, 4 to 6 times a day, one drop each time, for 8 weeks totally. Separately, before treatment, after 4-week treatment and 8-week treatment as well as in 8 weeks and 12 weeks of the follow-up, the levels of lactoferrin in tears were determined and the scores of the relevant symptoms of ocular surface such as eye dryness, foreign body sensation in the eyes and eye fatigue were evaluated. RESULTS: In the thread-embedding group, after 4-week and 8-week of treatment as well as in 8-week and 12-week follow-up, the scores of eye dryness, foreign body sensation, burning sensation of eye, phengophobia and eye fatigue were reduced significantly as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.05). In the medication group, the relevant symptoms of ocular surface were reduced after 4-week and 8-week treatment as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.05). In the follow-up, the scores of the relevant symptoms of ocular surface in the thread-embedding group were significantly lower than the medication group (all P<0.05). Separately, after 4-week treatment and 8-week treatment as well as in 8 weeks and 12 weeks of the follow-up, the levels of lactoferrin in tears in the thread-embedding group were significantly increased as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.05). The change was not obvious as compared with that before treatment in the medication group (P>0.05). The levels of lactoferrin in tears at each time point after treatment in the thread-embedding group were higher than the medication group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The acupoint thread-embedding therapy effectively improves in the relevant symptoms of ocular surface, such as eye dryness, foreign body sensation, burning sensation of eye, phengophobia and eye fatigue, and increases the level of lactoferrin in tears in the patients with dry eye syndrome of deficiency aqueous production. In the follow-up, the therapeutic effects of the acupoint thread-embedding therapy are significantly better than artificial tears eye drops.","['Liu, Jing', 'Lu, Ting-Ting', 'Han, De-Xiong', 'Wang, Chao', 'Chen, Li-Fang', 'Wang, Chen-Yao', 'Fang, Jian-Qiao']","['Liu J', 'Lu TT', 'Han DX', 'Wang C', 'Chen LF', 'Wang CY', 'Fang JQ']","['Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053.', 'Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",China,Zhongguo Zhen Jiu,Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion,8600658,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acupoint thread-embedding therapy', 'dry eye syndrome', 'lactoferrin in tears', 'ocular surface syndrome']",,2019/07/10 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.13703/j.0255-2930.2019.07.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2019 Jul 12;39(7):721-5. doi: 10.13703/j.0255-2930.2019.07.011.,,,20190906,,,"['Acupuncture Points', '*Asthenopia', '*Dry Eye Syndromes/therapy', 'Humans']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

People with CVS symptoms experience neck pain (NP), and people with NP can have visual symptoms. OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine differences in CVS symptoms in computer users with and without persistent NP. (2) To determine relationships between visual ergonomics, demographics, and CVS in those with and without persistent NP DESIGN: Comparative cross-sectional observational study METHOD: An online survey consisting of multiple questionnaires including the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q), Visual Symptoms Survey (VSS), and Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey (CISS) was completed by 167 participants. RESULTS: The persistent NP group had significantly higher CVS-Q, VSS, and CISS scores (p <0.01) compared to controls. No relationships were found between visual ergonomics, demographics, and visual symptoms in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: People with persitent NP are more likely to present with CVS than controls. Clinicians should consider assessing visual symptoms in people presenting with persisting NP.","['Teo, Caleb', 'Giffard, Phoebe', 'Johnston, Venerina', 'Treleaven, Julia']","['Teo C', 'Giffard P', 'Johnston V', 'Treleaven J']","['Division of Physiotherapy, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, 4072, Australia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire was used to evaluate the experience of surgeons who used DAVS for at least 6 months in the last 1 year. RESULTS: Twenty-three surgeons, including 12 fellows, answered the questionnaire. Eighty-two per cent of surgeons got accustomed to DAVS in <10 surgeries. The higher magnification provided by DAVS was perceived as helpful by 87.0% surgeons. Seventy-eight per cent surgeons felt that DAVS provided a bigger field of view. Colours displayed on DAVS appeared unnatural to 39.1%. Difficulty using three-dimensional glasses over spectacles, asthenopia and dry eye symptoms while using DAVS were faced by 17.4%, 17.4% and 21.7% surgeons, respectively. Difficulty in frequent switching between DAVS and AM was faced by 30.4% surgeons. Difficulty in depth perception, hand-eye coordination and performance anxiety while using DAVS was faced by 43.5%, 21.7 % and 30.4 % surgeons, respectively. Majority consultants did not have any imaging platform preference for most posterior segment procedures, while majority fellows preferred DAVS. Majority surgeons preferred AM for anterior segment procedures and complicated situations like small pupil, corneal oedema and surgical surprise(s). Once the surgeons became accustomed to DAVS, none of them had to shift back to AM during any case. CONCLUSION: It was easy to adapt to DAVS. DAVS was preferred for performing most posterior segment surgeries. Drawbacks like unnatural colours of the projected image and difficulty in performing anterior segment manoeuvres need to be addressed.","['Babu, Naresh', 'Kohli, Piyush', 'Jena, Soumya', 'Ramasamy, Kim']","['Babu N', 'Kohli P', 'Jena S', 'Ramasamy K']","['Vitreo-retinal services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Vitreo-retinal services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India kohli119@gmail.com.', 'Vitreo-retinal services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Aravind Eye Care System, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*imaging', '*macula', '*posterior chamber', '*retina', '*treatment surgery']",['Competing interests: None declared.'],2019/06/10 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2019/06/10 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['bjophthalmol-2019-314123 [pii]', '10.1136/bjophthalmol-2019-314123 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 2020 Mar;104(3):432-436. doi: 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2019-314123.

A self-administered questionnaire survey was used to obtain the hours of daily VDT work, exercise frequency, and the physical and mental health of the participants. The daily VDT working time of participants was 8.7 hours. Musculoskeletal pain and eye complaints were prevalent, and the participants had poor mental health status. When daily VDT operation time was more than 11 hours, VDT-related symptoms, including backache (odds ratios (OR) = 3.59), wrist pain (OR = 1.88), hip pain (OR = 2.42), dry eyes (OR = 2.22), and ocular soreness (OR = 2.16) were more likely to occur, and an increased risk of serious occupational stress (OR = 6.75) and job burnout (OR = 2.66) was found in internet workers. Compared with those who never exercised, appropriate exercise frequency (three times per week) was helpful to relieve pain in the shoulders (OR = 0.28), neck (OR = 0.45), back (OR = 0.30), lower back (OR = 0.25), and wrists (OR = 0.38), as well as to prevent vision loss (OR = 0.33) and job burnout (OR = 0.42). Therefore, avoiding excessive VDT exposure and performing moderate exercise could protect the physical and mental health of internet staff from the adverse effects of VDT.","['Cheng, Xiao', 'Song, Mengna', 'Kong, Jingxia', 'Fang, Xinglin', 'Ji, Yuqing', 'Zhang, Meibian', 'Wang, Hongmei']","['Cheng X', 'Song M', 'Kong J', 'Fang X', 'Ji Y', 'Zhang M', 'Wang H']","['Department of Social Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Institute of Social Medicine and Family Medicine, Hangzhou 311000, China. xcheng92@163.com.', 'Department of Social Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Institute of Social Medicine and Family Medicine, Hangzhou 311000, China. 21618445@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Social Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Institute of Social Medicine and Family Medicine, Hangzhou 311000, China. kongjx_79@126.com.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hangzhou 311000, China. xlfang@cdc.zj.cn.', 'National Institute of Occupational Health and Poisoning Control, Beijing 100050, China. jiyq@niohp.china.cdc.cn.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hangzhou 311000, China. mbzhang@cdc.zj.cn.', 'Department of Social Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Institute of Social Medicine and Family Medicine, Hangzhou 311000, China. rosa@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*exercise', '*internet staff', '*mental health', '*physical health', '*visual display terminal']",,2019/05/28 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/05/26 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph16101829 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph16101829 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 May 23;16(10). pii: ijerph16101829. doi: 10.3390/ijerph16101829.,,20190523,20191206,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*epidemiology', 'China/epidemiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', '*Internet', 'Male', '*Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prevalence', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC6572178,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0513-9047', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7565-9040']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 77 individuals (154 eyes) were evaluated on two separate days with a 1-month interval. They completed two questionnaires: OSDI and PEG Eye Fatigue. An objective ocular surface assessment was performed: Schirmer test without anesthetic, DR-1a Dry Eye Monitor, hyperemia evaluation, lacrimal break up, presence of keratitis and lesions in the conjunctiva, as well as near accommodation point and near convergence point. After the first evaluation, the subjects were divided into two groups: group A (< 2 hours of computer working) and group B (> 2 hours of computer working). Some environmental measures to reduce complaints and recommendation of use of artificial tears were explained to the latter. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the majority of the parameters evaluated in the group B, in relation to the morning period (group A) - tear film (p = 0.032), hyperemia (p < 0.001), BUT (p < 0.001), keratitis (p < 0.001), conjunctival lesion (p = 0.002) and accommodation point (p < 0.001). In the evaluation - one month later - there were no statistically significant differences in any of the parameters analysed in the group A, and in group B there was a decrease in most parameters at the end of that period - Schirmer test (p = 0.005), lacrimal film (p = 0.022), keratitis (p < 0.001), conjunctival lesion (p = 0.005) and fatigue score (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: It was thus possible to show the appearance of ocular fatigue and ocular surface changes with prolonged use of computers (> 2 hours) as well as a significant improvement in symptomatology (subjective assessment) as well as of ocular surface changes (objective evaluation) with the implementation of postural measures, regular breaks and use of lubricants. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, of digital asthenopia in which, in addition to the subjective evaluation, the presence of ocular surface modifications (objective assessment) were evaluated and the respective improvement with the aforementioned ergophthalmological measures were evaluated. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the increased overall level of awareness that we need to have to face the rapid and wide-scale changes driven by the emergence of digital technology and, more particularly, its impact on user's vision and posture. We concluded that the longer we use the electronic devices (more than two hours) the more severe the complaints and rates of ocular surface changes are. Environmental and ocular strategies can attenuate or even eliminate the discomfort caused by this syndrome, and increase professional performance and quality of life.","['Vaz, Fernando Trancoso', 'Henriques, Susana Pinto', 'Silva, Diana Silveira', 'Roque, Joana', 'Lopes, Ana Sofia', 'Mota, Mafalda']","['Vaz FT', 'Henriques SP', 'Silva DS', 'Roque J', 'Lopes AS', 'Mota M']","['Servico de Oftalmologia.

The purpose of this research was to take a 21st century look at aniseikonia. Methods: Kellogg Eye Center patient records were evaluated for measurable aniseikonia in patients tested with the Aniseikonia Helper, a tablet-based application. Anaglyph slides for the synoptophore were developed to test the limits of induced aniseikonia on stereopsis and fusion. A survey was developed to determine how frequently members of the American Association of Certified Orthoptists (AACO) examine and treat patients with aniseikonia.Results: The prevalence of measurable aniseikonia in this cohort was 7.8%. Moderate amounts of induced aniseikonia, 4% induced image size disparity, disrupt fusion and can cause a loss of stereopsis. Eighty percent of responding AACO members see patients with aniseikonia and among those, 25% see them on a monthly basis. Treatment options, other than wearing contact lenses, are limited to occlusion or fogging techniques. Conclusions: Aniseikonia remains a frequent complaint among patients. The ophthalmologic community needs to use the best methods for measuring aniseikonia and to develop better methods for treating aniseikonia.","['Furr, Bruce A']",['Furr BA'],"['a Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences , W.

Five 27'' rear-screen mock-ups with distinct curvature radii (600R, 1140R, 2000R, 4000R, and flat) were used. Ten individuals per display curvature completed a series of four 15min comparison-proofreading trials at a 600mm viewing distance. Only proofreading speed benefited from display curvature, with 600R providing the highest mean proofreading speed. Proofreading speed increased and accuracy decreased for all display curvatures over the 1h proofreading period. Visual discomfort, visual fatigue, and mental workload increased during the first 15min of proofreading. A decrease in critical fusion frequency during that period indicated increases in visual fatigue and mental workload. A short break between 15min proofreading tasks could be considered to prevent further degradation of task performance and ocular health.","['Park, Sungryul', 'Kyung, Gyouhyung', 'Choi, Donghee', 'Yi, Jihhyeon', 'Lee, Songil', 'Choi, Byeonghwa', 'Lee, Seungbae']","['Park S', 'Kyung G', 'Choi D', 'Yi J', 'Lee S', 'Choi B', 'Lee S']","['Department of Human Factors Engineering, 50 UNIST-gil, Ulju-gun, Ulsan, 44919, Republic of Korea.

This technique was designed to overcome measurement burdens by using non-contact methods. The pupillary response is related to cognitive function by a neural pathway and may be an indicator of 3D cognitive fatigue. Twenty-six undergraduate students (including 14 women) watched both 2D and 3D versions of a video for 70 min. The participants experienced visual fatigue after viewing the 3D content. Measures such as subjective rating, response time, event-related potential latency, heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) alpha power, and task-evoked pupillary response (TEPR) latency were significantly different. Multitrait-multimethod matrix analysis indicated that HEP and TEPR latency measures had stronger reliability and higher correlations with 3D cognitive fatigue than other measures. TEPR latency may be useful for quantitatively determining 3D visual fatigue, as it can be easily used to evaluate 3D visual fatigue using a non-contact method without measuring burden.","['Park, Sangin', 'Mun, Sungchul', 'Lee, Dong Won', 'Whang, Mincheol']","['Park S', 'Mun S', 'Lee DW', 'Whang M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Opt,Applied optics,0247660,,,,,2019/05/03 06:00,2019/08/24 06:00,['2019/05/03 06:00'],"['2019/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['409337 [pii]', '10.1364/AO.58.003467 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Opt. 2019 May 1;58(13):3467-3480. doi: 10.1364/AO.58.003467.,,,20190823,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Cognition', 'Electrocardiography', 'Evoked Potentials/physiology', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods', '*Infrared Rays', 'Male', 'Photography/*instrumentation', 'Pupil/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, we wanted to prove objective and subjective difference between two types of soft contact lenses during working with digital device. We had in total 37 subjects in our study. The first group contained 37 subjects with average age 23 years without important eye pathology. The second group contained 8 subjects with the same average age without important eye pathology. In the first group of subjects, we measured binocular accommodative facility (BAF) and binocular vergence facility (BVF) with and without addition 1 D and with and without relieving prism 2 pD BO at working distance 45 cm. In the second group, we evaluated BAF, BVF and standardized questionnaire (Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire - CVS-Q, Sequi M. 2015) during usage of two types of soft contact lenses. The first type of contact lenses (type 1) contained relieving prism for PC working and type 2 was soft contact lens with aspheric design. In the first group of subjects, we measured these values: BAF without addition = 12.78 cpm, BAF with addition = 11.57 cpm, BVF without prism = 12.32 cpm, BVF with prism = 11.59 cpm. In the second group of subjects, we measured with contact lens type 1 these values: BAF = 12.13 cpm, BVF = 13.63 cpm and questionnaire score 9.43 points. With contact lens type 2 we measured BAF = 11.75 cpm, BVF = 11.63 cpm and questionnaire score 12.86 points. We proved statistically important different between two variable only in the first group between BAF with and without addition and BVF with and without relieving prism. In conclusion, we found statistically important decrease in variable BAF and BVF with usage of addition and relieving prism. We found that neither addition nor prism have positive influence on increase of BAF and BVF. Subjects in second group had higher BAF and BVF values with both types of contact lenses in comparison with natural values. We found that with contact lens type 1 (with addition) subjects had higher BAF and BVF values in comparison with contact lens type 2 (aspheric). Subjects with contact lens type 1 had also lower (better) questionnaire score, i.e. 9.43 versus 12.86 point.

METHODS: The study included 576 adolescents attending urban schools who were surveyed regarding their electronic device usage. Additional information on the factors that may have an effect on ocular symptoms was collected. RESULTS: Twenty percent of students aged 11 in the study population use digital devices on a daily basis, in comparison with 50% of students aged 17. In addition to using these devices as homework aids, one third of study participants reported using digital devices for reading instead of conventional textbooks. The majority of students preferred sitting on a chair while reading (77%; 445 students), with only 21% (123 students) preferring to lie on the bed and 8 students alternating between chair and bed. There was a significant association between the students who preferred to lie down and those who experienced eyestrain, as reported by a little over one fourth of the student population (27%). Out of 576 students, 18% (103) experienced eyestrain at the end of the day after working on digital devices. CONCLUSIONS: The increased use of digital devices by adolescents brings a new challenge of digital eyestrain at an early age. Our study reports the patterns of electronic device usage by school children, evaluates factors associated with eyestrain and highlights the need for further investigation of these issues.","['Ichhpujani, Parul', 'Singh, Rohan Bir', 'Foulsham, William', 'Thakur, Sahil', 'Lamba, Amtoj Singh']","['Ichhpujani P', 'Singh RB', 'Foulsham W', 'Thakur S', 'Lamba AS']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, India.', 'Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', 'Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, London, UK.

Therefore, during these surgical procedures, surgeons experience back and neck pain. To solve this problem, new technology, such as wearable displays, is required to help surgeons maintain comfortable postures and enjoy advanced functionality during microsurgery. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a surgical microscope system that would work with wearable devices. It would include a head-mounted display (HMD) that can offer 3D surgical images and allow a flexible and comfortable posture instead of fixed eyepieces of surgical microscope and can also provide peripheral visual field with its optical see-through function. METHODS: We designed and fabricated a surgical microscope system that incorporates a see-through type 3D HMD, and we developed an image processing software to provide better image quality. The usability of the proposed system was confirmed with preclinical examination. Seven ENT (ear, nose, and throat) surgical specialists and 8 residents performed a mock surgery-axillary lymph node dissection on a rat. They alternated between looking through the eyepieces of the surgical microscope and viewing a 3D HMD screen connected to the surgical microscope. We examined the success of the surgery and asked the specialists and residents to grade eye fatigue on a scale of 0 (none) to 6 (severe) and posture discomfort on a scale of 1 (none) to 5 (severe). Furthermore, a statistical comparison was performed using 2-tailed paired t test, and P=.00083 was considered significant. RESULTS: Although 3D HMD case showed a slightly better result regarding visual discomfort (P=.097), the average eye fatigue was not significantly different between eyepiece and 3D HMD cases (P=.79). However, the average posture discomfort, especially in neck and shoulder, was lower with 3D HMD display use than with eyepiece use (P=.00083). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a see-through type 3D HMD-based surgical microscope system and showed through preclinical testing that the system could help reduce posture discomfort. The proposed system, with its advanced functions, could be a promising new technique for microsurgery.","['Kim, Cheol-Hwan', 'Ryu, Seon-Young', 'Yoon, Ji-Young', 'Lee, Hyoung-Kwon', 'Choi, Nak-Gu', 'Park, Il-Ho', 'Choi, Hae-Young']","['Kim CH', 'Ryu SY', 'Yoon JY', 'Lee HK', 'Choi NG', 'Park IH', 'Choi HY']","['Institute of Advanced Convergence Technology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Device Development Center, Daegu-Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Laboratory, Green Optics CO, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Lab, Hulust CO, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Korea University Medical College, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Device Development Center, Daegu-Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,101624439,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*3D imaging', '*head-mounted display', '*microsurgery', '*surgical microscope']",,2019/03/08 06:00,2019/03/08 06:01,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:01 [medline]']","['v7i3e11251 [pii]', '10.2196/11251 [doi]']",epublish,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Mar 7;7(3):e11251. doi: 10.2196/11251.,"['(c)Cheol-Hwan Kim, Seon-Young Ryu, Ji-Young Yoon, Hyoung-Kwon Lee, Nak-Gu Choi,', 'Il-Ho Park, Hae-Young Choi.

METHODS: A total of 150 patients using glasses and having asthenopia between 15 and 30 years of age were subjected to thorough eye examination including binocular vision testing and refraction. Of them 26 individuals were found to have convergence insufficiency with fusion weakness and exophoria >6 pd. Subjects with amblyopia, manifest strabismus and other ocular diseases were excluded from the study. Modified glasses (overcorrection of myopia by -0.5 D Sph & under correction of hypermetropia by +0.5 D Sph) were given along with newly designed Smartphone-based fusion exercises. RESULTS: Near point of convergence improved by 2.89 +/- 1.08 cm, positive fusion vergence by -10.2 +/- 3.25 pd and near phoria by 3.13 +/- 0.32 pd (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates the efficacy of Smartphone-based fusion exercises, in conjunction with modified glasses prescriptions, in the management of symptomatic convergence and fusion insufficiency. Indeed, this novel, newly designed approach for convergence insufficiency improves symptoms by reducing near point of convergence and degree of exophoria and increasing fusional vergence.","['Mohan, Amit', 'Kaur, Navjot', 'Sen, Pradhnya', 'Jain, Elesh', 'Gajraj, Manju']","['Mohan A', 'Kaur N', 'Sen P', 'Jain E', 'Gajraj M']","['a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology & Strabismus , Sadguru Netra Chikitsalaya & Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology , Chitrakoot , India.', 'b Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology , Global Hospital Institute of Ophthalmology , Abu Road , India.', 'a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology & Strabismus , Sadguru Netra Chikitsalaya & Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology , Chitrakoot , India.', 'a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology & Strabismus , Sadguru Netra Chikitsalaya & Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology , Chitrakoot , India.', 'c Department of Ophthalmology , SMS Medical College , Jaipur , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Binocul Vis Ocul Motil,Journal of binocular vision and ocular motility,101730067,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fusion weakness', 'Smartphone', 'fusion exercise', 'glass prescription']",,2019/03/02 06:00,2019/08/03 06:00,['2019/03/02 06:00'],"['2019/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/2576117X.2019.1578594 [doi]'],ppublish,J Binocul Vis Ocul Motil. 2019 Jan-Mar;69(1):30-33. doi: 10.1080/2576117X.2019.1578594.

Herein, we explored the correlation between eye fatigue and thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL). Included in the NFL are intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which are associated with trigeminal pain. This retrospective cross-sectional study included outpatients with best-corrected visual acuity above 20/30 in both eyes and without dry eye, glaucoma, or retinal disease. A total of 1981 patients were initially enrolled and 377 patients were declared as eligible for the study analysis. We tested subjects for the presence of major ocular symptoms and measured thickness of ganglion cell complex (GCC) using optical coherence tomography. A total of 377 outpatients (46.4% men, mean age of 57.1 years) were enrolled for analysis, based on the interview-reported prevalence of six eye symptom, as follows: 31.5% for eye fatigue, 19.2% for blurring, 18.6% for dryness, 15.7% for photophobia, 13.5% for irritation, and 4.6% for pain. The macular GCC was significantly thicker in subjects with eye fatigue compared to the group not reporting eye fatigue (103.8 mum versus 100.3 mum, P = 0.014). Regression analysis identified eye fatigue (P = 0.026, beta=0.122, adjusted for age and sex) and dryness (P =0.024, beta=0.130) as significantly correlated with the macular GCC thickness, while the full macular thickness showed no significant correlation. In conclusions, eye fatigue and dryness were positively associated with thickness of the macular GCC. Nonvisual symptoms might therefore play a role in the development of eye fatigue.","['Ayaki, Masahiko', 'Kuze, Manami', 'Kondo, Mineo', 'Tsubota, Kazuo', 'Negishi, Kazuno']","['Ayaki M', 'Kuze M', 'Kondo M', 'Tsubota K', 'Negishi K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Otake Clinic Moon View Eye Center, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Division of Ophthalmology, Matsusaka General Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,,,,2019/02/28 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3014567 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Jan 23;2019:3014567. doi: 10.1155/2019/3014567. eCollection 2019.,,20190123,20190610,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asthenopia/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Glaucoma, Open-Angle/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Fibers/*pathology/physiology', 'Optic Disk/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Retina/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/pathology', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence', 'Visual Fields/physiology']",PMC6364103,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9481-0164', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4569-1792', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8874-7111', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2892-9810']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Background illumination, light source, light compensation, position of the display, contrast and glare are environmental factors associated with computer vision syndrome. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of reflected glare and visual field lighting on computer vision syndrome. METHODS: In a reflected glare experiment, participants performed a two-hour visual task using a glossy, matte, or glare-free surface display in two visual environments (normal, glare). In a visual field lighting experiment, participants performed the visual task in dim lighting, uneven supplementary lighting, or uniform supplementary lighting. Visual function parameters, including critical fusion frequency, heterophoria, amplitude of accommodation and accommodative facility were evaluated by the investigators and a visual fatigue questionnaire was completed before and after the visual task. Visual performance was also recorded. In addition, the variation of pupil size under different lighting conditions was analysed. RESULTS: Critical fusion frequency was the only visual function parameter which decreased significantly after the visual task. The questionnaire score was significantly higher in a glare environment and was lower when the task was performed using a glare-free display. Visual performance was significantly worse in the glossy display group. The increment in the questionnaire score was smaller in the uniform supplementary lighting group. Visual performance was significantly worse in the dim lighting or uneven supplementary lighting group, but not in the uniform supplementary lighting group. Variation in pupil size was significantly greater in the dim lighting condition than in the supplementary lighting condition. CONCLUSION: Critical fusion frequency is an effective indicator of computer vision syndrome. Glare-free displays could alleviate visual fatigue and preserve visual performance. Uniform supplementary lighting could decrease variation in pupil size and prevent eye strain.","['Lin, Chao-Wen', 'Yeh, Feng-Ming', 'Wu, Bo-Wen', 'Yang, Chang-Hao']","['Lin CW', 'Yeh FM', 'Wu BW', 'Yang CH']","['Department of Ophthalmology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Optometry, Yuanpei University of Medical Technology, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Optometry, Yuanpei University of Medical Technology, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Clin Exp Optom,Clinical & experimental optometry,8703442,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*computer vision syndrome', '*critical fusion frequency', '*glare', '*supplementary lighting']",,2019/02/26 06:00,2020/07/04 06:00,['2019/02/27 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cxo.12878 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Optom. 2019 Sep;102(5):513-520. doi: 10.1111/cxo.12878.

Knowing their prevalence among schoolchildren is fundamental to define strategies for action. The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of these conditions in children in 5th and 6th school years in inland Portugal and to assess the impact that each visual condition has on their quality of life, based on the level of visual symptoms. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was carried out with children enrolled in the 5th and 6th school years. 372 children (192 girls) were assessed, with average ages of 10.9 +/- 0.9 years. Refractive error and binocular vision assessment, integrating accommodative parameters, were used to analyse the visual condition. Symptoms were quantified using the Portuguese version of the CISS (Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey). RESULTS: The prevalence of definite Convergence Insufficiency (CI) in the children assessed was 2%. A prevalence of 6,8% could be considered if clinically significant CI (high suspect and definite categories) cases are accounted. In relation to Accommodative Insufficiency (AI), a frequency rate of 10% was recorded, with 3% of the evaluated children presenting AI and CI simultaneously. The symptoms score was higher in AI than in CI. CONCLUSIONS: A frequency of approximately 10% was found for each one of the visual syndromes, and it was verified that visual discomfort is common among teenagers who carry these conditions. In cases of asthenopia, such as headaches and loss of concentration, associated with near vision activities, there is a requirement to evaluate the quality of binocular vision.","['Nunes, Amelia F', 'Monteiro, Pedro M L', 'Ferreira, Francisco B P', 'Nunes, Antonio S']","['Nunes AF', 'Monteiro PML', 'Ferreira FBP', 'Nunes AS']","['Department of Physics, University of Beira Interior, 6200, Covilha, Portugal. amnunes@ubi.pt.', 'Centro de Investigacao em Ciencias da Saude (CICS), Covilha, Portugal. amnunes@ubi.pt.', 'Centro Clinico e Experimental em Ciencias da Visao, Covilha, Portugal. amnunes@ubi.pt.', 'ubimedical, Covilha, Portugal. amnunes@ubi.pt.', 'Department of Physics, University of Beira Interior, 6200, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Centro de Investigacao em Ciencias da Saude (CICS), Covilha, Portugal.', 'Centro Clinico e Experimental em Ciencias da Visao, Covilha, Portugal.', 'ubimedical, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Department of Physics, University of Beira Interior, 6200, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Centro de Investigacao em Ciencias da Saude (CICS), Covilha, Portugal.', 'Centro Clinico e Experimental em Ciencias da Visao, Covilha, Portugal.', 'ubimedical, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Sociais e Humanas, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Nucleo de Estudos em Ciencias Empresariais (NECE), Covilha, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Ophthalmol,BMC ophthalmology,100967802,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodative insufficiency', 'Children', 'Convergence insufficiency', 'Normal binocular vision', 'Visual discomfort']",,2019/02/23 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2019/02/23 06:00'],"['2018/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12886-019-1061-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12886-019-1061-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Ophthalmol. 2019 Feb 21;19(1):58. doi: 10.1186/s12886-019-1061-x.,,20190221,20190325,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Child', '*Convergence, Ocular', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Portugal/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of Life', 'Vision Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Vision, Binocular']",PMC6385397,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5001-3534'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aniseikonia is associated with anisometropia, as both anisometropia itself and the optical correction for anisometropia can cause aniseikonia. Image size differences above one to three per cent can be clinically symptomatic. Common symptoms include asthenopia, headache and diplopia in vertical gaze. Size differences of three and more impair binocular visual functions such as binocular summation and stereopsis. Above five per cent of aniseikonia, binocular inhibition or suppression tend to occur to prevent diplopia and confusion. Aniseikonia can be measured using a range of techniques and can be corrected or reduced by prescribing contact lenses or specially designed spectacle lenses. Subjective testing of aniseikonia is the only way to accurately measure the overall perceived amount of aniseikonia. However, currently it is not routinely assessed in most clinical settings. At least two-thirds of patients with amblyopia have anisometropia, thus we may expect aniseikonia to be common in patients with anisometropic amblyopia. However, aniseikonia may not be experienced by the patient under normal binocular viewing conditions if the image from the amblyopic eye is of poor quality or is too strongly suppressed for image size differences to be recognised. This lack of binocular simultaneous perception in amblyopia may also prevent the measurement of aniseikonia, as most common techniques require direct comparisons of images seen by each eye. Current guidelines for the treatment of amblyopia advocate full correction of anisometropia to equalise image clarity, but do not address aniseikonia. Significant image size differences between eyes may lead to suppression and abnormal binocular adaptations. It is possible that correcting anisometropia and aniseikonia simultaneously, particularly at the initial diagnosis of anisometropia, would reduce the need to develop suppression and improve treatment outcomes for anisometropic amblyopia.","['South, Jayshree', 'Gao, Tina', 'Collins, Andrew', 'Turuwhenua, Jason', 'Robertson, Kenneth', 'Black, Joanna']","['South J', 'Gao T', 'Collins A', 'Turuwhenua J', 'Robertson K', 'Black J']","['School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'School of Optometry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Clin Exp Optom,Clinical & experimental optometry,8703442,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*amblyopia', '*aniseikonia', '*anisometropia', '*suppression']",,2019/02/23 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/02/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cxo.12881 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Optom. 2019 Nov;102(6):556-565. doi: 10.1111/cxo.12881.

This review synthesises the available literature and considers these symptoms in the context of a binocular vision and/or ocular surface aetiology. Eye discomfort with smartphones and tablets is discussed alongside similar symptoms reported with desktop computer use. Handheld devices differ from computers in viewing position and distance, screen size and luminance, and patterns of use. Accommodation is altered with handheld device use, with increased lag and decreased amplitude. Smartphone and tablet use results in reduced fusional convergence and possibly a receded near point of convergence. This is similar to what happens with computer use. Findings related to blink rate with smartphone and tablet use are contradictory, perhaps due to the influence of task difficulty, and there is limited evidence related to blink amplitude. Reduced blink rate and amplitude are consistently reported with computer use. Use of handheld digital devices, like computers, may adversely impact tear stability. There is insufficient evidence to support the impact of handheld devices on tear volume, although this is reduced with computer use. The available literature does not conclusively link eye and visual discomfort symptoms reported with handheld digital devices, with changes in binocular vision, blinking or ocular surface. However, there is a gap in our understanding of symptoms which occur with smartphone and tablet use in the context of how these devices are used. In addition, studies are required in high users such as teenagers, and in patients with dry eye or accommodative/binocular vision anomalies, all of whom may have a higher risk of symptoms. A better understanding of symptom aetiology can guide clinical advice to minimise adverse impacts on visual and ocular surface health and discomfort.","['Jaiswal, Sukanya', 'Asper, Lisa', 'Long, Jennifer', 'Lee, Abigail', 'Harrison, Kirsten', 'Golebiowski, Blanka']","['Jaiswal S', 'Asper L', 'Long J', 'Lee A', 'Harrison K', 'Golebiowski B']","['School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Clin Exp Optom,Clinical & experimental optometry,8703442,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*aesthenopia', '*binocular vision', '*blinking', '*computer vision syndrome', '*digital device', '*dry eyes', '*eye strain', '*ocular surface', '*smartphone']",,2019/01/22 06:00,2020/07/04 06:00,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2018/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cxo.12851 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Optom. 2019 Sep;102(5):463-477. doi: 10.1111/cxo.12851.

A computer haploscope was used to measure phoria values and changes in the eye position after introducing 6 prism diopters base out in front of the right eye. Phoria values were measured with a nonius paradigm every minute for a period of 10 minutes during adaptation. The results showed that subjects with symptomatic heterophoria are characterized by a lower rate of prism adaptation and adapted to a smaller extent with respect to the control group. The group with high but asymptomatic heterophoria showed prolonged adaptation time but after several minutes of binocular viewing the subjects were able to adapt to the prism to a level similar to the control group. These findings suggest that an impairment in the slow vergence control system may be responsible for the inability to fully reduce vergence effort, which results in poor vergence ranges and asthenopic symptoms during prolonged viewing.","['Przekoracka-Krawczyk, Anna', 'Michalak, Krzysztof Piotr', 'Pyzalska, Paulina']","['Przekoracka-Krawczyk A', 'Michalak KP', 'Pyzalska P']","['Laboratory of Vision Science and Optometry, Faculty of Physics, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.', 'Vision and Neuroscience Laboratory, NanoBioMedical Centre, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Vision Science and Optometry, Faculty of Physics, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.', 'Vision and Neuroscience Laboratory, NanoBioMedical Centre, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Vision Science and Optometry, Faculty of Physics, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/01/19 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0211039 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-26417 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jan 18;14(1):e0211039. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0211039. eCollection 2019.,,20190118,20191021,,,"['*Adaptation, Ocular', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', '*Convergence, Ocular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Strabismus/*physiopathology', 'Vision Tests']",PMC6338415,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2401-4135', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0267-5605', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9664-4278']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is limited evidence to support the proposal that DES results from the blue light emitted by these devices. PURPOSE: The visual and ocular symptoms commonly experienced when viewing digital screens are collectively termed DES. The emission spectrum of modern digital displays frequently includes a high percentage of blue light. Being higher in energy, these short wavelengths may contribute to DES. This study examined the effect of a BB filter on symptoms of DES during a sustained near-vision task. METHODS: Twenty-three young, visually normal subjects were required to perform a 30-minute reading task from a tablet computer. The digital screen was overlaid with either a BB or neutral-density (ND) filter producing equal screen luminance. During each session, the accommodative response, pupil diameter, and vertical palpebral aperture dimension were measured at 0, 9, 19, and 29 minutes after the start of the reading task. Immediately following each session, subjects completed a questionnaire to quantify symptoms of DES. RESULTS: The BB filter blocked 99% of the wavelengths between 400 and 500 nm. The mean total symptom scores (+/-1 SEM) for the BB and ND filter conditions were 42.83 (3.58) and 42.61 (3.17), respectively (P = .62). No significant differences in accommodation or vertical palpebral aperture dimension were observed between the two filter conditions, although the magnitude of the mean accommodative response did increase significantly during the first 9 minutes of the task (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: A filter that eliminated 99% of the emitted blue light was no more effective at reducing symptoms of DES than an equiluminant ND filter. There is little evidence at this time to support the use of BB filters to minimize near work-induced asthenopia.","['Palavets, Tatsiana', 'Rosenfield, Mark']","['Palavets T', 'Rosenfield M']","['SUNY College of Optometry, New York, New York *Rosenfield@sunyopt.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2018/12/21 06:00,2019/12/21 06:00,['2018/12/21 06:00'],"['2018/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/OPX.0000000000001318 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2019 Jan;96(1):48-54. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0000000000001318.,,,20191220,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*prevention & control', 'Computers, Handheld', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Filtration/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Male', 'Reading', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Current soft contact lens wearers with -0.75 to -1.75 D astigmatism in each eye were binocularly fitted with toric (1-Day ACUVUE MOIST for astigmatism) and spherical (1-Day ACUVUE MOIST) contact lenses in random order. After each fitting and at 1-week follow-up, high- and low-contrast visual acuities were measured. Electromyography was used to objectively evaluate eyestrain. Linear mixed models were used to assess differences between toric and spherical contact lenses. RESULTS: The mean age (+/-SD) of the 60 participants was 27.5+/-5.0 years, spherical refractive error was -3.68+/-2.01 D, and cylinder was -1.28+/-0.36 D. High- and low-contrast visual acuities with toric lenses were better than with spherical lenses at both fitting (toric high-contrast: -0.065+/-0.078 and low-contrast: 0.133+/-0.103 vs. spherical high-contrast: 0.001+/-0.104 and low-contrast: 0.224+/-0.107) and follow-up (toric high-contrast: -0.083+/-0.087 and low-contrast: 0.108+/-0.107 vs. spherical high-contrast: -0.015+/-0.095 and low-contrast: 0.211+/-0.104) (all P<0.0001). Electromyography-measured eyestrain was less with toric versus spherical contact lenses at fitting (least-square ratio of toric over spherical=0.72; P=0.0019) but not at follow-up (ratio=0.86; P=0.11). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that toric contact lenses provided improved objective measures of vision in a low-to-moderate astigmatic population.","['Berntsen, David A', 'Cox, Stephanie M', 'Bickle, Katherine M', 'Mathew, Jessica H', 'Powell, Daniel R', 'Seidman, Scott H', 'Little, Borm Kim', 'Lorenz, Kathrine Osborn', 'Nichols, Jason J']","['Berntsen DA', 'Cox SM', 'Bickle KM', 'Mathew JH', 'Powell DR', 'Seidman SH', 'Little BK', 'Lorenz KO', 'Nichols JJ']","['The Ocular Surface Institute (D.A.B., D.R.P.), University of Houston College of Optometry, Houston, TX; University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry (S.M.C., J.J.N.), Birmingham, AL; The Ohio State University College of Optometry (K.M.B.), Columbus, OH; Alcon Laboratories (J.H.M.), Fort Worth, TX; Department of Biomedical Engineering (S.H.S.), University of Rochester, Rochester, NY; and Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc (B.K.L., K.O.L.), Jacksonville, FL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Eye Contact Lens,Eye & contact lens,101160941,IM,,,,2018/12/19 06:00,2019/01/18 06:00,['2018/12/19 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/ICL.0000000000000528 [doi]', '00140068-201901000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Eye Contact Lens. 2019 Jan;45(1):28-33. doi: 10.1097/ICL.0000000000000528.,,,20190117,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy', '*Contact Lenses, Hydrophilic', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Electromyography', 'Equipment Design', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oculomotor Muscles/*physiopathology', 'Refraction, Ocular/*physiology', 'Refractive Errors/complications/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Single-Blind Method', '*Visual Acuity', 'Young Adult']",PMC6319569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possibility that ORBEYE (OE), a novel instrument that excludes eyepiece lenses and allows for microsurgery by observation of the 4K3D monitor, could replace microscopes. METHODS: We report 22 clinical cases by 5 experienced neurosurgeons and the comparative results of training 10 residents. An observation study with questionnaire survey was conducted on usability. Twelve items including image quality, eyestrain, and function of the arm were evaluated. RESULTS: The following 22 clinical procedures were conducted: surgery for intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2) and brain tumor (n = 8), laminectomy (n = 3), aneurysm clipping (n = 3), vascular anastomosis (n = 2), carotid endarterectomy (n = 2), and nerve decompression (n = 1). No complications were observed. The fluorescent study, including indocyanine-green and 5-aminolevunic acid, allowed for clear depiction on the 4K monitor. The surgeon could operate in a comfortable posture. Similar to the microscope, it was possible to change the optical and viewing axes with the OE, but the OE was switched to the microscope or endoscope in hematoma removal and pituitary surgery. Residents judged that eyestrain was strong (P = .0096). Experienced neurosurgeons acting as assistants judged that the scope arm's range of movement was narrow (P = .0204). Sixty percent of residents judged that the OE was superior to the microscope. CONCLUSION: Although based on limited experience, it was not possible to substitute the microscope with the OE in all operations; however, the OE surpasses the microscope in terms of ergonomic features.","['Murai, Yasuo', 'Sato, Shun', 'Yui, Kanako', 'Morimoto, Daijiro', 'Ozeki, Tomohiro', 'Yamaguchi, Masahiro', 'Tateyama, Kojiro', 'Nozaki, Toshiki', 'Tahara, Shigeyuki', 'Yamaguchi, Fumio', 'Morita, Akio']","['Murai Y', 'Sato S', 'Yui K', 'Morimoto D', 'Ozeki T', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Tateyama K', 'Nozaki T', 'Tahara S', 'Yamaguchi F', 'Morita A']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery for Community Health, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown),"Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",101635417,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Endoscope', '*Fluorescence', '*Microscopy', '*Microsurgery']",,2018/12/07 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2018/12/04 06:00'],"['2018/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['5227600 [pii]', '10.1093/ons/opy277 [doi]']",ppublish,Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown). 2019 Jun 1;16(6):707-716. doi: 10.1093/ons/opy277.,['Copyright (c) 2018 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.'],,20200922,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'IX6J1063HV (Indocyanine Green)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminolevulinic Acid', '*Asthenopia', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Brain Neoplasms/surgery', 'Cerebral Revascularization/instrumentation/methods', 'Child', 'Coloring Agents', 'Cranial Nerve Neoplasms/surgery', 'Decompression, Surgical/instrumentation/methods', 'Endarterectomy, Carotid/instrumentation/methods', '*Ergonomics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Internship and Residency', 'Intracranial Aneurysm/surgery', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages/surgery', 'Laminectomy/instrumentation/methods', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/surgery', 'Meningioma/surgery', 'Microsurgery/*instrumentation/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurilemmoma/surgery', 'Neurosurgical Procedures/*instrumentation/methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents', '*Posture']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary objective was to assess knowledge and practices related to preventing computer vision syndrome symptoms. METHODS: The data for this cross-sectional study were collected through a self-administered questionnaire distributed to 713 female undergraduates studying business and medicine in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included computer vision syndrome validated symptoms and factors associated with computer vision syndrome development. RESULTS: The most common symptom due to prolonged computer use was neck or shoulder pain, reported by 82.2% of the subjects. Overall, 66.5% of the subjects suffered from headache and 51.5% from dry eyes, in mild, moderate, or severe form. Business students were 1.6 times as likely as medical students to suffer from computer vision syndrome (odds ratio = 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 2.24). The use of electronic devices for more than 5 h (odds ratio = 1.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.16) was also associated with experiencing computer vision syndrome symptoms. Regarding computer vision syndrome prevention, factors such as hours of use, screen distance, screen brightness, and room illumination showed statistically significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of computer vision syndrome symptoms was significantly higher among business students, who reported lower awareness and poor practice measures of computer use recommendations. Relevant awareness campaigns focusing on the appropriate use of computers are highly recommended.","['Al Tawil, Layan', 'Aldokhayel, Sara', 'Zeitouni, Leena', 'Qadoumi, Tala', 'Hussein, Siham', 'Ahamed, Shaik Shaffi']","['Al Tawil L', 'Aldokhayel S', 'Zeitouni L', 'Qadoumi T', 'Hussein S', 'Ahamed SS']","['Medical Interns, King Saud University College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Interns, King Saud University College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Interns, King Saud University College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Interns, King Saud University College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Interns, King Saud University College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Family & Community Medicine, King Saud University College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Eur J Ophthalmol,European journal of ophthalmology,9110772,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Computer vision syndrome', 'Saudi Arabia', 'electronic devices', 'university students', 'vision problems']",,2018/11/27 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2018/11/27 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1120672118815110 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Ophthalmol. 2020 Jan;30(1):189-195. doi: 10.1177/1120672118815110.

Methods: In all, 50 eyes of 50 patients with stage 3 or 4 macular hole were randomized and macular hole surgery [inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique] was performed in 25 eyes using 3D viewing system and 25 eyes using conventional microscope. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon. Patients were followed up for a period of 3 months. Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity, macular hole index, intraoperative parameters such as total surgical time, total ILM peel time, number of flap initiations, duration of Brilliant Blue G dye exposure, illumination intensity, postoperative logMAR visual acuity, and macular hole closure rates were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: The mean age was 67.92 +/- 7.95 and 67.96 +/- 4.78 years in both groups, respectively (P = 0.98). Gender (P = 0.38) and right versus left eye (P = 0.39) were also comparable. Preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (P = 0.86, 0.92), macular hole index (P = 0.96), total surgical time (P = 0.56), total ILM peel time (P = 0.49), number of flap initiations (P = 0.11), and macular hole closure rates (P = 0.61) were not statistically significant when compared between the two groups. Illumination intensity of microscope (100% vs 45%) and endoillumination (40% vs 13%) were significantly less in the 3D viewing system. Conclusion: The clinical outcomes of macular hole surgery using 3D viewing system are not inferior to that of conventional microscopes, and it has the added advantages of better ergonomics, reduced phototoxicity, peripheral visualization, magnification, and less asthenopia, and it serves as a good educational tool.","['Kumar, Atul', 'Hasan, Nasiq', 'Kakkar, Prateek', 'Mutha, Vineet', 'Karthikeya, R', 'Sundar, Dheepak', 'Ravani, Raghav']","['Kumar A', 'Hasan N', 'Kakkar P', 'Mutha V', 'Karthikeya R', 'Sundar D', 'Ravani R']","['Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",India,Indian J Ophthalmol,Indian journal of ophthalmology,0405376,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['3D heads-up viewing system', 'digitally assisted vitreoretinal surgery', 'macular hole']",['There are no conflicts of interest'],2018/11/20 06:00,2019/01/30 06:00,['2018/11/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJOphthalmol_2018_66_12_1816_245633 [pii]', '10.4103/ijo.IJO_59_18 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Ophthalmol. 2018 Dec;66(12):1816-1819. doi: 10.4103/ijo.IJO_59_18.,,,20190129,,,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Male', 'Microscopy/*methods', '*Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retinal Perforations/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*surgery', '*Surgery, Computer-Assisted', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence', 'Visual Acuity/physiology']",PMC6256912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eighty healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Subjective symptoms and asthenopia were evaluated using the ocular surface disease index (OSDI), visual analogue scale (VAS), and computer vision syndrome (CVS) score before and after smartphone or computer display (control) use. The status of the tear film was evaluated using fluorescein film break-up time (FBUT), non-invasive keratograph break up time (NIKBUT), Schirmer score, keratoepitheliopathy (KEP), and tear meniscus height (TMH). Oxidative stress markers in the tear film including hexanoyl lysine (HEL), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the tear film were measured using ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the ocular surface were measured through 2',7'-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate. All measurements were conducted at baseline, and after use for 1 and 4 h. RESULTS: All parameters showed no significant group-wise differences at baseline. Scores of OSDI, VAS, fatigue, burning sensation, and dryness showed significant increases after 1 and 4 h of smartphone use compared with those at baseline (all P < 0.05). The smartphone group showed higher OSDI, fatigue, burning, and dryness scores than the control group at 4 h. Smartphone use showed significantly decreased FBUT and NIBUT at 4 h than those at baseline (P < 0.01). In the smartphone group, the concentration of HEL significantly increased at 4 h compared with that at baseline and 1 h (P < 0.01). Both groups showed increased ROS with higher value in the smartphone group versus the control group at 4 h (P < 0.01).

Using computer for prolonged time led to the users at greater health risk of computer vision syndrome (CVS). Computer vision syndrome is the leading occupational health problem of the twenty-first century. About 70 percent of computer users are suffered from CVS. Besides the health problems, CVS causes inefficiency at workplace and deteriorate quality of work. The problem of CVS and its risk factors are not well known in Ethiopia. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence of CVS and associated factors among computer user government employees in Debre Tabor town from February to March, 2016. Multistage random sampling method was applied to select 607 study participants, and the data were collected by using a structured questionnaire. Computer vision syndrome was measured by self-reported method. Bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS version 20. Significance level was obtained at 95% CI and p value < 0.05. Results: The prevalence of CVS was 422 (69.5%) with 95% CI of 65.60, 73.0%. Blurred vision, eyestrain, and eye irritation were the commonest reported symptoms of CVS with proportion of 62.60%, 47.63%, and 47.40%, respectively. Occupation: officer (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.74) and secretary (AOR = 9.17), daily computer usage (AOR: 2.29), and preexisting eye disease (AOR = 3.19) were risk factors for CVS. However, computer users with high payment, who took regular health break, and with good knowledge on computer safety measures were less impacted by CVS. Conclusion: The prevalence of computer vision syndrome was found to be higher in Debre Tabor town. Monthly income, occupation, daily computer usage, regular health break, knowledge, and preexisting eye disease were predictor variables for CVS. Optimizing exposure time, improving awareness on safety measures, and management support are important to tackle CVS.","['Dessie, Awrajaw', 'Adane, Fentahun', 'Nega, Ansha', 'Wami, Sintayehu Daba', 'Chercos, Daniel Haile']","['Dessie A', 'Adane F', 'Nega A', 'Wami SD', 'Chercos DH']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety, Institute of Public Health, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'South Gondar Zonal Health Office, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.', 'Public Health Faculty, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety, Institute of Public Health, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety, Institute of Public Health, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Environ Public Health,Journal of environmental and public health,101516361,IM,,,,2018/10/12 06:00,2019/01/25 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/4107590 [doi]'],epublish,J Environ Public Health. 2018 Sep 16;2018:4107590. doi: 10.1155/2018/4107590. eCollection 2018.,,20180916,20190124,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethiopia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6165611,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5436-9936', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4776-3975']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Five thousand students were randomly assessed using a self-reported asthenopia questionnaire. The students' demographic characteristics and habits regarding digital device use were recorded. Univariate analysis was performed to select potential risk factors, and multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios for the selected risk factors of interest. RESULTS: Among the 4786 students who completed the survey, the prevalence of asthenopia was 53.3%. Multivariate analysis revealed significant relationships between asthenopia and each of the following: level of digital reliance (OR 1.350, 95%CI: 1.230-1.481), workload, time spent on computer per day, sex and time spent on handheld digital devices in bed and at desk. Aerobic exercise duration (OR 0.912, 95%CI: 0.839-0.990) was found to be strong predictor of less asthenopia complaints. CONCLUSION: Asthenopia appears to be common among college students in China. Preventative measures against asthenopia include limiting the amount of time spent using digital devices in bed (<0.5 h), adopting a posture of lying on one's back while doing so and engaging in aerobic exercise for more than one hour per day. Furthermore, studies on this topic are needed.","['Xu, Yupeng', 'Deng, Guoying', 'Wang, Weiheng', 'Xiong, Shuyu', 'Xu, Xun']","['Xu Y', 'Deng G', 'Wang W', 'Xiong S', 'Xu X']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Fundus Disease, Shanghai Engineering Center for Visual Science and Photomedicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Trauma Center, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Fundus Disease, Shanghai Engineering Center for Visual Science and Photomedicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Fundus Disease, Shanghai Engineering Center for Visual Science and Photomedicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Ophthalmol,Acta ophthalmologica,101468102,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'digital device', 'prevalence', 'risk factor']",,2018/10/03 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2018/10/02 06:00'],"['2017/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/aos.13885 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol. 2019 May;97(3):e442-e447. doi: 10.1111/aos.13885.

Methods: Sixty healthy subjects (30 men and 30 women) aged 19 through 29 years with no history of ocular disease were recruited. All subjects spent 3 consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. During the first and second nights, the subjects were not exposed to light during sleep, but during the third night, they were exposed to ambient light, measuring 5 or 10 lux at the eye level, which was randomly allocated with 30 subjects each. The visual function and ocular fatigue were assessed at 7 a.m. on the 3rd and 4th mornings, using best-corrected visual acuity, refractive error, conjunctival hyperemia, tear break-up time, maximal blinking interval, ocular surface temperature, and subjective symptoms reported on a questionnaire. Results: Three men and three women subjects failed to complete the study (4 in the 5 lux; 2 from the 10 lux). For the entire 54 subjects, tear break-up time and maximal blinking interval decreased (P = 0.015; 0.010, respectively), and nasal and temporal conjunctival hyperemia increased significantly after sleep under any ambient light (P < 0.001; 0.021, respectively). Eye tiredness and soreness also increased (P = 0.004; 0.024, respectively). After sleep under 5 lux light, only nasal conjunctival hyperemia increased significantly (P = 0.008). After sleep under 10 lux light, nasal and temporal conjunctival hyperemia, eye tiredness, soreness, difficulty in focusing, and ocular discomfort increased significantly (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Nocturnal ambient light exposure increases ocular fatigue. Avoiding ambient light during sleep could be recommended to prevent ocular fatigue.","['Suh, Young-Woo', 'Na, Kun-Hoo', 'Ahn, Soh-Eun', 'Oh, Jaeryung']","['Suh YW', 'Na KH', 'Ahn SE', 'Oh J']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Yeoncheon-gun Health Center and County Hospital, Yeoncheon, Korea.', 'Sungmo Eye Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Dry Eye Syndrome', 'Eye', 'Fatigue', 'Lighting', 'Sleep']",['Disclosure: The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],2018/09/19 06:00,2019/03/16 06:00,['2018/09/19 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3346/jkms.2018.33.e248 [doi]'],epublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2018 Aug 17;33(38):e248. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2018.33.e248. eCollection 2018 Sep 17.,,20180817,20190315,,['J Korean Med Sci. 2018 Sep 03;33(38):e257.

Therefore, accommodation and vergence of 30- to 40-year-old, myopic, soft contact lens wearing subjects with symptoms of asthenopia and no history of using multifocal lenses were evaluated. Patients and methods: In this prospective, observational study, 253 subjects with asthenopia were evaluated by 25 qualified practitioners, each at a different clinical site. Subjects were 30-40 years in age, had symptoms of soreness, eyestrain, tired eyes, or headaches with near work, regularly performed 2-3 consecutive hours of near work, and were undiagnosed with presbyopia. Amplitude of accommodation (AC) and near point convergence (NPC) were measured with a Royal Air Force binocular gauge. Triplicate push up and push down AC and NPC measures were recorded, and average AC values were compared to those calculated using the Hofstetter formula (HF). Results: The average AC push up/push down value was significantly better than the HF prediction for this age range (8.04+/-3.09 vs 6.23+/-0.80 D), although 22.5% of subjects had mean AC below their HF value (5.36+/-0.99 D). The average NPC push up/push down value was 12.0+/-4.69 cm. The mean binocular AC value using the push up measure was significantly better than the push down measure (8.5+/-3.4 vs 7.6+/-3.0 D). The mean NPC value using the push up measure was significantly worse than the push down measure (13.0+/-5.0 vs 11.0+/-4.7 cm). The most frequent primary diagnosis was ill-sustained accommodation (54%), followed by accommodative insufficiency (18%), and accommodative infacility (12%). Conclusion: Based upon a standardized assessment of accommodation and vergence, ill-sustained accommodation was the most frequent diagnosis among this population.","['Reindel, William', 'Zhang, Lening', 'Chinn, Joseph', 'Rah, Marjorie']","['Reindel W', 'Zhang L', 'Chinn J', 'Rah M']","['Vision Care, Bausch & Lomb Inc, Rochester, NY, Marjorie.rah@bausch.com.', 'Vision Care, Bausch & Lomb Inc, Rochester, NY, Marjorie.rah@bausch.com.', 'J Chinn LLC, Lafayette, CO, USA.', 'Vision Care, Bausch & Lomb Inc, Rochester, NY, Marjorie.rah@bausch.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Clin Optom (Auckl),Clinical optometry,101730504,,['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation', 'eyestrain', 'lag', 'myopia', 'spherical aberration', 'vergence']","['Disclosure William Reindel and Marjorie Rah are employees of Bausch & Lomb Inc;', 'Lening Zhang was an employee of Bausch & Lomb Inc at the time of the study; and', 'Joseph Chinn is a paid consultant to Bausch & Lomb Inc.

The associations between the frequency of convergence insufficiency, gender, refractive error and accommodative insufficiency were investigated. METHODS: This was a single-site, prospective cross-sectional study. In total, 928 eligible teenagers (mean age 15.9 +/- 0.8) from a local high school in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China participated in this study. Refraction and binocular vision tests were performed on all eligible participants. The following three signs were used to classify participants: sign 1, exophoria at near at least 4(triangle up) greater than at far; sign 2, receded near point of convergence (>/= 6 cm break point); and sign 3, insufficient near positive fusional vergence (that is, failing Sheard's criterion or </= 15(triangle up) break point). Diagnostic groups of convergence insufficiency classification were defined as follows: (1) 3-Sign convergence insufficiency (all three signs present); (2) 2-Sign convergence insufficiency (sign 1 plus sign 2 or 3); (3) 1-Sign convergence insufficiency (sign 1 only); and (4) no convergence insufficiency (that is, participants not classified into one of the above groups). RESULTS: The number and frequency of individuals with 3-Sign, 2-Sign, and 1-Sign convergence insufficiency as well as no convergence insufficiency group were 25 (2.7 per cent), 119 (12.8 per cent), 303 (32.6 per cent) and 481 (51.8 per cent), respectively. Gender (chi(2) = 36.6, df = 3, p < 0.001), refractive error grouping (chi(2) = 37.7, df = 9, p < 0.001) and accommodative insufficiency (chi(2) = 15.4, df = 3, p = 0.002) were all significantly associated with convergence insufficiency. Male gender, hyperopia, or accommodative insufficiency were more likely to be classified with 3-Sign convergence insufficiency. The frequency of accommodative insufficiency was 9.5 per cent (88 of 928 participants). CONCLUSION: Compared to the data from school- and clinic-based populations in the USA and South Africa, the data from this sample of Chinese high school students showed a lower frequency of 3-Sign convergence insufficiency (2.7 per cent). Convergence insufficiency was associated with refractive error, gender and accommodative insufficiency.","['Ma, Martin Ming-Leung', 'Long, Wen', 'She, Zhihui', 'Li, Wanping', 'Chen, Xuhui', 'Xie, Lingmei', 'Scheiman, Mitchell', 'Liu, Yuling', 'Chen, Xiang']","['Ma MM', 'Long W', 'She Z', 'Li W', 'Chen X', 'Xie L', 'Scheiman M', 'Liu Y', 'Chen X']","['State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Optometry and Optical, Guangzhou Business Vocational School, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Optometry and Optical, Guangzhou Business Vocational School, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Optometry and Optical, Guangzhou Business Vocational School, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Research, Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Optometry and Optical, Guangzhou Business Vocational School, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Clin Exp Optom,Clinical & experimental optometry,8703442,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chinese', '*asthenopia', '*binocular vision', '*convergence insufficiency', '*exophoria', '*vergence']",,2018/09/13 06:00,2020/04/01 06:00,['2018/09/13 06:00'],"['2017/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cxo.12838 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Optom. 2019 Mar;102(2):166-171. doi: 10.1111/cxo.12838.

Some dietary constituents have been reported to be effective in improving ocular disorders while few clinical studies have been performed. We evaluated the effects of heat-killed Lactobacillus paracasei KW 3110 on improving ocular disorders and symptoms of eye fatigue among healthy human subjects with VDT loads. METHODS: In vitro, the effect of L. paracasei KW3110 on blue light-induced human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cell damage. For clinical studies, 62 healthy Japanese volunteers of 35 to 45 years of age who had experienced eye fatigue were randomized into two groups and given a placebo or L. paracasei KW3110-containing supplements for eight weeks. The primary endpoint was changes in VDT load-induced eye fatigue as determined by critical flicker frequency four and eight weeks after the start of supplementation. RESULTS: In vitro, blue light-induced human retinal cell death was suppressed with the culture supernatants of cells treated with L. paracasei KW3110. In clinical study, the VDT load-induced reduction of critical flicker frequency tended to be milder in the L. paracasei KW3110 group when compared with the placebo group during the fourth week. Subgroup analysis classified by the degree of eye fatigue showed that the VDT load-induced reduction of critical flicker frequency was significantly better in the high-level eye fatigue subjects from the L. paracasei KW3110 group when compared with the placebo group during the fourth week (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: L. paracasei KW3110 suppressed blue light-induced retinal pigment epithelial cell death. In the clinical study, ingestion of L. paracasei KW3110 had a potential to improve eye fatigue induced by VDT loads especially high levels of eye fatigue. However, further studies should be required to show more dependable clinical efficacy of L. paracasei KW3110.","['Morita, Yuji', 'Jounai, Kenta', 'Miyake, Mika', 'Inaba, Masaharu', 'Kanauchi, Osamu']","['Morita Y', 'Jounai K', 'Miyake M', 'Inaba M', 'Kanauchi O']","['Research Laboratories for Health Science & Food Technologies, Kirin Company, Ltd., 1-13-5 Fukuura Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama-shi, Kanagawa 236-0004, Japan.

Therefore, to integrate the information, users must repeatedly switch context and refocus the eyes. To focus at different distances, the user's eyes must accommodate, which when done repeatedly can cause eyestrain and degrade task performance. An experiment was conducted that examined switching context and focal distance between a real and an AR environment, using a text-based visual search task and a monocular optical see-through AR display. Both context switching and focal distance switching resulted in significantly reduced performance. In addition, repeatedly performing the task caused visual fatigue to steadily increase. Performance was particularly poor for virtual text presented at optical infinity, and for target letters that participants tried to read before their eyes had completely accommodated to a new focal distance. The results show that context switching and focal distance switching are important AR user interface design issues.","['Gabbard, Joseph L', 'Mehra, Divya Gupta', 'Swan, J Edward']","['Gabbard JL', 'Mehra DG', 'Swan JE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,IEEE Trans Vis Comput Graph,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,9891704,IM,,,,2018/07/12 06:00,2020/02/08 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TVCG.2018.2832633 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Vis Comput Graph. 2019 Jun;25(6):2228-2241. doi: 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2832633.

METHODS: A total of 1022 students were selected from five universities by a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. They were surveyed via a self-administered questionnaire including socio-demographic features, dietary and lifestyle habits, eye-related symptoms, eye care habits and history of diseases. Ascertainment of asthenopia was based on participants' subjectively reported symptoms. The associations between fruit and vegetable intake with asthenopia risk were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: There were no significant associations between total fruit and vegetable, total vegetable, or fruit and the risk of asthenopia. Higher intake of dark-green leafy vegetable was likely to be inversely associated with asthenopia risk [odd ratio (OR): 0.60; 95%CI: 0.37-0.97; Ptrend=0.21] after controlling for nondietary and dietary risk factors. Stratified analysis showed that the inverse association between dark-green leafy vegetable intake and asthenopia risk was limited to participants with suboptimal eyesight (OR: 0.45; 95%CI: 0.25-0.82; Ptrend=0.05), wearing glasses (OR: 0.35; 95%CI: 0.17-0.72; Ptrend=0.03) or using computer >/=3h/d (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25-0.93; Ptrend=0.08). CONCLUSION: A higher consumption of dark-green leafy vegetable is associated with a lower asthenopia risk among college students with suboptimal eyesight and poor eye care habits.","['Guo, Fang', 'Zhang, Qiang', 'Fan, Meng-Nan', 'Ma, Le', 'Chen, Chu', 'Liu, Xiao-Hong', 'Jiang, Hong', 'Liu, Yan']","['Guo F', 'Zhang Q', 'Fan MN', 'Ma L', 'Chen C', 'Liu XH', 'Jiang H', 'Liu Y']","[""The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Shaanxi Province for Craniofacial Precision Medicine Research, College of Stomatology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Shaanxi Province for Craniofacial Precision Medicine Research, College of Stomatology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Ministry of Education of China, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710054, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Shaanxi Province for Craniofacial Precision Medicine Research, College of Stomatology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Shaanxi Province for Craniofacial Precision Medicine Research, College of Stomatology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Int J Ophthalmol,International journal of ophthalmology,101553860,,['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'college students', 'epidemiology', 'fruit', 'vegetable']",,2018/07/07 06:00,2018/07/07 06:01,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2017/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18240/ijo.2018.06.21 [doi]', 'ijo-11-06-1020 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Ophthalmol. 2018 Jun 18;11(6):1020-1027. doi: 10.18240/ijo.2018.06.21. eCollection 2018.,,20180618,,,,,PMC6010382,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: The aim of conducting this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of astigmatism and its relationship to gender, age, school grade levels and spherical ametropia. Methods: Using a multi-stage random cluster sampling, 1589 children who included 635 (40%), males, and 954 (60%), females were selected from 13 out of a sample frame of 60 schools. Their ages ranged between 13 and 18 years with a mean of 15.81+/-1.56 years. The parameters evaluated included visual acuity using the LogMAR chart and refractive errors measured using an autorefractor and then refined subjectively. Axis of astigmatism was presented in the vector method where positive values of J0 indicated with-the-rule, negative values described against-the-rule and J45 represented oblique astigmatism. Results: The mean cylinder power was -0.09 +/- 0.27 and mainly with-the-rule, J0 = 0.01 +/- 0.11. The overall prevalence of clinically significant astigmatism (</= - 0.75 cylinder) in the sample was 3.1% [(95% Confidence interval = 2.1-4.1%)]. Cylinder of at least - 0.25 power was considered to classify astigmatism types. Thus, the estimated distributions of types of astigmatism were: axis- 11.5%, sphero-astigmatism 10.1% and magnitude-astigmatism 11.2% while 67.2% had no cylinder of any magnitude. Conclusion: The prevalence of astigmatism is relatively low in this population studied. Older children and those in high school grade levels were more likely to have with-the-rule or against-the-rule astigmatism. The prevalence of astigmatism were comparable within but not across regions.","['Wajuihian, Samuel Otabor']",['Wajuihian SO'],"['Discipline of Optometry, School of Health Sciences , University of KwaZulu-Natal, Private Bag X54001, Durban 4000, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Uganda,Afr Health Sci,African health sciences,101149451,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Astigmatism prevalence', 'South Africa', 'school children']",,2018/06/26 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/06/26 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4314/ahs.v17i4.25 [doi]', 'jAFHS.v17.i4.pg1160 [pii]']",ppublish,Afr Health Sci. 2017 Dec;17(4):1160-1171. doi: 10.4314/ahs.v17i4.25.,,,20181001,,,"['Adolescent', 'African Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data', 'Age Distribution', 'Astigmatism/*epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Distribution', 'South Africa/epidemiology']",PMC5870290,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Prospective intervention test Thirty volunteers were recruited to watch videos on the same VDT in a dark environment, about 40 cm from the screen. Volunteers were supposed to watch videos in the night shift mode that reduces the amount of blue light for 1 hour. At the same time of the second day, they watched the same videos on the VDT in the normal mode for 1 hour. Tear film break-up time (BUT), corneal fluorescein staining scores, lipid layer thickness (LLT), times of blinking in 19.1 seconds and the ratio of partial blinking in 19.1 seconds were measured before and after each watching. Meanwhile, volunteers were asked to complete a questionnaire about their subjective experience after watching. Results: BUT, corneal fluorescein staining scores and LLT showed no significant decreases in the volunteers after they watched videos on the VDT in the night shift mode [BUT before watching: (8.08+/-3.15)s, BUT after watching in the night shift mode: (5.31+/-2.49)s, t=-0.52, P>0.05], but there were significant decreases after they watched videos in the normal mode [BUT after watching in the normal mode: (3.35+/-1.95) s, t=2.40, P<0.05]. At the same time, there was a significant difference between night shift mode and normal mode[BUT after watching in the night shift mode (5.31+/-2.49)s, BUT after watching in the normal mode: (3.35+/-1.95)s, t=3.67, P<0.05). Times of blinking and the ratio of partial blinking in 19.1 seconds were increased modestly after watching in 2 different modes, but there was no significant difference(times of blinking after watching in the night shift mode were 5.55+/-3.27, times of blinking after watching in the normal mode were 5.93+/-3.59, t=-0.92, P>0.05). The questionnaire results showed that 70.0%(21) of the volunteers reported mild discomfort including eye dryness, itching, pain, foreign body sensation, redness and asthenopia, 46.7%(14) reported no difference between the 2 modes, 36.7%(11) preferred the night shift mode, 16.6%(5) felt better with the normal mode, and 80.0%(24) would like to try the night shift mode in their daily life. Conclusions: Use of VDTs for a short period of time can lower the stability of tear film. The night shift mode may cause less damage to the ocular surface than the normal mode. High-energy blue light from VDTs can be a risk factor in the ocular surface damage, but the damage is reversible.

This review aims to provide an overview of the extensive literature on digital eye strain research with particular reference to the clinical management of symptoms. As many as 90 per cent of digital device users experience symptoms of digital eye strain. Many studies suggest that the following factors are associated with digital eye strain: uncorrected refractive error (including presbyopia), accommodative and vergence anomalies, altered blinking pattern (reduced rate and incomplete blinking), excessive exposure to intense light, closer working distance, and smaller font size. Since a symptom may be caused by one or more factors, a holistic approach should be adopted. The following management strategies have been suggested: (i) appropriate correction of refractive error, including astigmatism and presbyopia; (ii) management of vergence anomalies, with the aim of inducing or leaving a small amount of heterophoria (~1.5(Delta) Exo); (iii) blinking exercise/training to maintain normal blinking pattern; (iv) use of lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) to help alleviate dry eye-related symptoms; (v) contact lenses with enhanced comfort, particularly at end-of-day and in challenging environments; (vi) prescription of colour filters in all vision correction options, especially blue light-absorbing filters; and (vii) management of accommodative anomalies. Prevention is the main strategy for management of digital eye strain, which involves: (i) ensuring an ergonomic work environment and practice (through patient education and the implementation of ergonomic workplace policies); and (ii) visual examination and eye care to treat visual disorders. Special consideration is needed for people at a high risk of digital eye strain, such as computer workers and contact lens wearers.","['Coles-Brennan, Chantal', 'Sulley, Anna', 'Young, Graeme']","['Coles-Brennan C', 'Sulley A', 'Young G']","['Johnson and Johnson Vision Care Inc, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.', 'Vision Care Institute of Johnson and Johnson Medical Ltd, Wokingham, UK.', 'Visioncare Research, Farnham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Clin Exp Optom,Clinical & experimental optometry,8703442,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*digital devices', '*digital eye strain', '*management']",,2018/05/26 06:00,2019/11/09 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cxo.12798 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Optom. 2019 Jan;102(1):18-29. doi: 10.1111/cxo.12798.

METHODS: A total of 120 VDT workers (62M/58F; 31-63 years old) and 40 age/sex matched no-VDT volunteers (19M/21F; 30-60 years old) were enrolled in the study. Participants completed the OSDI questionnaire and were subjected to clinical assessment of ocular surface status, including ocular symptoms and tear film parameters. NGF and iNOS levels were quantified in tear samples and their expressions correlated with OSDI, ocular symptoms and tear film parameters. RESULTS: 59.17% of the studied population was symptomatic based on OSDI scores. Women were more commonly affected. The most frequent symptom was asthenopia and except for dryness, no differences were found between genders regarding other symptoms. A statistically significant decrease in NGF levels was found between normal and moderate (p < 0.05) and between mild and moderate (p < 0.05) OSDI grading. iNOS expression was increased in moderate OSDI grading compared to normals (p < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between NGF and respectively OSDI results, dryness and blurry vision (p < 0.05). No correlations were found among NGF, iNOS and ocular surface parameters (Schirmer, BUT, ocular surface staining). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that NGF and iNOS levels contribute to VDT ocular discomfort. Further studies are required to better understand the relationship between NGF and iNOS in VDT ocular surface.","['Cortes, Magdalena', 'Esposito, Graziana', 'Sacco, Roberto', 'Gillet, Veronique Bernadette', 'Ianni, Andrea', 'Micera, Alessandra']","['Cortes M', 'Esposito G', 'Sacco R', 'Gillet VB', 'Ianni A', 'Micera A']","['a Research Laboratories in Ophthalmology , IRCCS GB Bietti Foundation , Rome , Italy.', 'b Occupational and Health Care Department , University Campus Bio-Medico , Rome , Italy.', 'a Research Laboratories in Ophthalmology , IRCCS GB Bietti Foundation , Rome , Italy.', 'b Occupational and Health Care Department , University Campus Bio-Medico , Rome , Italy.', 'c Department of Occupational and Health Care , ENI (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi) , Rome , Italy.', 'b Occupational and Health Care Department , University Campus Bio-Medico , Rome , Italy.', 'a Research Laboratories in Ophthalmology , IRCCS GB Bietti Foundation , Rome , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Eye Res,Current eye research,8104312,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*NGF', '*Video display workers', '*dry eye', '*iNOS', '*tear proteins']",,2018/05/10 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/02713683.2018.1475014 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Eye Res. 2018 Sep;43(9):1119-1125. doi: 10.1080/02713683.2018.1475014.

To determine whether ingesting green tea containing anthocyanins improves visual function and blood pressure (BP) in healthy adults, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed. A total of 120 healthy subjects, aged between 20 and 60 years and with a systolic BP (SBP) value of &le;125 and <155 and a diastolic BP (DBP) value <95, or a DBP of &le;75 mmHg and <95 mmHg and a SBP <155 mmHg, were randomly assigned to one of three groups. For 12 weeks, the placebo group received barley extract without catechin; another group received &ldquo;Sunrouge&rdquo; extract containing 11.2 mg anthocyanin and 323.6 mg epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG); and a third group received &ldquo;Yabukita&rdquo; extract containing 322.2 mg EGCG. Home BP, accommodation ability, visual analog scale questionnaires for eyestrain, and metabolic-associated markers were analyzed at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 of the intake period.

As far as our information goes, this is the first adaptation of a DBN structure-based probabilistic framework for inferring the 3D viewer's state of visual fatigue. METHODS: Our measurement focuses on the interdependencies between each factor and the phenomena of visual fatigue in stereoscopy. Specifically, the implementation of DBN with using multiple features (e.g. contextual, contactless and contact physiological features) and dynamic factor provides a systematic scheme to evaluate 3D visual fatigue. RESULTS: In contrast to measurement results between the mean opinion score (MOS) and Bayesian network model (with static Bayesian network and DBN), the visual fatigue in stereoscopy at time slice t is influenced by a dynamic factor (time slice t-1). In the presence of dynamic factors (time slice t-1), our proposed measuring scheme based on DBN is more comprehensive. CONCLUSION: (i) We cover more features for inferring the visual fatigue, more reliably and accurately; (ii) at different time slices, the dynamic factor features are significant for inferring the visual fatigue state of stereoscopy.","['Yuan, Zhongyun', 'Zhuo, Kai', 'Zhang, Qiang', 'Zhao, Chun', 'Sang, Shengbo']","['Yuan Z', 'Zhuo K', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhao C', 'Sang S']","['MicroNano System Research Center, Key Laboratory of Advanced Transducers and Intelligent Control System of Ministry of Education and Shanxi Province, College of Information and Computer Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China.', 'MicroNano System Research Center, Key Laboratory of Advanced Transducers and Intelligent Control System of Ministry of Education and Shanxi Province, College of Information and Computer Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China.', 'MicroNano System Research Center, Key Laboratory of Advanced Transducers and Intelligent Control System of Ministry of Education and Shanxi Province, College of Information and Computer Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China.', 'College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.', 'MicroNano System Research Center, Key Laboratory of Advanced Transducers and Intelligent Control System of Ministry of Education and Shanxi Province, College of Information and Computer Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Acta Ophthalmol,Acta ophthalmologica,101468102,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['3D displays', '3D visual fatigue', 'dynamic Bayesian networks', 'physiological features']",,2018/04/27 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/aos.13784 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol. 2019 May;97(3):e435-e441. doi: 10.1111/aos.13784.

METHODS: Thirty healthy adults observed 2-D and 3-D movies on the same television from a 3m distances during 2D, 3D-A (with better 3D glasses), and 3D-B (with poorer 3D glasses) viewing conditions. Visual quality index, including modulation transfer function index (MTFI), higher order aberration root mean square (RMS), vertical coma (VC), horizontal coma (HC) and spherical aberration (SA), were assessed before and after each viewing condition. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to assess the changes of each test variable before and after movie viewing. RESULTS: Participants watching movies with 3D-B conditions experienced higher change of MTFI, RMS, VC and HC but smaller SQ, compared with 2D and 3D-A (P< 0.05). Additionally, higher MTFI but smaller SQ was found for 3D-A compared with 2D viewing condition (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: While prolonged viewing 2-D and 3-D movies would lead to poorer visual performance, 3-D glasses with better quality can play the major role in reducing visual ability for users. The change of human eye wavefront aberration might be useful for the evaluation of visual fatigue in the future.","['Yang, Fan', 'Gu, Huiru', 'Li, Man', 'Cai, Jianqi', 'Zhou, Qianxiang', 'Lam, Wing-Kai']","['Yang F', 'Gu H', 'Li M', 'Cai J', 'Zhou Q', 'Lam WK']","['School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.', 'Li Ning Sports Science Research Center, Beijing, China.', 'National Research Center for Rehabilitation Technical Aids, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Rehabilitation Technical Aids for Old-Age Disability, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Rehabilitation Technical Aids Analysis and Identification of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Beijing, China.', 'National Research Center for Rehabilitation Technical Aids, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Rehabilitation Technical Aids for Old-Age Disability, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Rehabilitation Technical Aids Analysis and Identification of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Beijing, China.', 'China National Institute of Standardization, Beijing, China.', 'School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.', 'Li Ning Sports Science Research Center, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Technol Health Care,Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,9314590,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['2-D/3-D', 'visual fatigue', 'visual function', 'wavefront aberration']",,2018/04/25 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['THC174206 [pii]', '10.3233/THC-174206 [doi]']",ppublish,Technol Health Care. 2018;26(S1):79-86. doi: 10.3233/THC-174206.,,,20181029,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Male', '*Motion Pictures']",PMC6004945,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to determine the effects of lens design on parameters that may influence the refractive management of pre-presbyopic adult computer users. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of wearing conventional single-vision lenses (SVL) versus progressive addition lenses (PAL) on the working distance and refractive status. METHODS: Adult computer users, recruited from two age cohorts (18 to 25 years, n = 19; 30 to 40 years, n = 45), were prescribed SVLs and PALs designed for use with handheld digital devices. For each lens type, the working distance and refractive shift (post-task - pre-task) were measured immediately after lens delivery (T0) and after 1 month of lens wear (T1). Working distances were recorded with an automatic ultrasound device while the participants were playing a video game. Refractive status through the subjects' glasses was measured before (pre-task) and after playing the game (post-task). Questionnaires assessing the frequencies of 10 digital work-related visual symptoms were conducted for both lens types at T1. RESULTS: Switching from SVL to PAL increased the working distance in both cohorts (mean +/- SEM = 1.88 +/- 0.60 cm; P = .002) and induced a small but significant positive refractive shift (+0.08 +/- 0.04 D, P = .021) in the older cohort at T1. In the younger cohort, the changes in working distance due to the switching lens design were correlated with myopic error (r = +0.66, P = .002). In the older cohort, the changes in refractive shift due to switching lens design were correlated with amplitude of accommodation at both time points (r for T0 and T1 = -0.32 and -0.30, respectively; both P < .05). Progressive addition lens was rated as causing less ""increased sensitivity to light"" compared with SVL. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from SVL to PAL increased the working distance and induced a positive refractive shift in the majority of pre-presbyopic adults.","['Kee, Chea-Su', 'Leung, Tsz Wing', 'Kan, Ka-Hung', 'Lam, Christie Hang-I']","['Kee CS', 'Leung TW', 'Kan KH', 'Lam CH']","['School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2018/04/24 06:00,2019/09/14 06:00,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/OPX.0000000000001211 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2018 May;95(5):457-467. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0000000000001211.,,,20190913,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/physiopathology/*therapy', '*Computers', 'Cross-Over Studies', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Presbyopia/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Refraction, Ocular/physiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Task Performance and Analysis', 'Vision Tests', 'Young Adult']",PMC5943073,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02775396'],,,,,,,,,

Asthenopia is a term generally used to describe symptoms related to (prolonged) use of the eyes like ocular fatigue, headache, pain or aching around the eyes, and burning and itchiness of the eyelids. The prevalence of asthenopia during or after work on a computer ranges from 46.3% to 68.5%. Uncorrected or under-corrected refractive error can contribute to the development of asthenopia. A refractive error is an error in the focusing of light by the eye and can lead to reduced visual acuity. There are various possibilities for optical correction of refractive errors including eyeglasses, contact lenses and refractive surgery. OBJECTIVES: To examine the evidence on the effectiveness, safety and applicability of optical correction of refractive error for reducing and preventing eye symptoms in computer users. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; Embase; Web of Science; and OSH update, all to 20 December 2017. Additionally, we searched trial registries and checked references of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials of interventions evaluating optical correction for computer workers with refractive error for preventing or treating asthenopia and their effect on health related quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate, we combined studies in a meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies with 381 participants. Three were parallel group RCTs, three were cross-over RCTs and two were quasi-randomised cross-over trials. All studies evaluated eyeglasses, there were no studies that evaluated contact lenses or surgery. Seven studies evaluated computer glasses with at least one focal area for the distance of the computer screen with or without additional focal areas in presbyopic persons. Six studies compared computer glasses to other types of glasses; and one study compared them to an ergonomic workplace assessment. The eighth study compared optimal correction of refractive error with the actual spectacle correction in use. Two studies evaluated computer glasses in persons with asthenopia but for the others the glasses were offered to all workers regardless of symptoms. The risk of bias was unclear in five, high in two and low in one study. Asthenopia was measured as eyestrain or a summary score of symptoms but there were no studies on health-related quality of life. Adverse events were measured as headache, nausea or dizziness. Median asthenopia scores at baseline were about 30% of the maximum possible score.Progressive computer glasses versus monofocal glassesOne study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between various progressive computer glasses and monofocal computer glasses after one-year follow-up (mean difference (MD) change scores 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.0 to 5.4 on a 100 mm VAS scale, low quality evidence). For headache the results were in favour of progressive glasses.Progressive computer glasses with an intermediate focus in the upper part of the glasses versus other glassesIn two studies progressive computer glasses with intermediate focus led to a small decrease in asthenopia symptoms (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.23, low-quality evidence) but not in headache score in the short-term compared to general purpose progressive glasses. There were similar small decreases in dizziness. At medium term follow-up, in one study the effect size was not statistically significant (SMD -0.64, 95% CI -1.40 to 0.12). The study did not assess adverse events.Another study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between progressive computer glasses and monofocal computer glasses after one-year follow-up (MD change scores 1.44, 95% CI -6.95 to 9.83 on a 100 mm VAS scale, very low quality evidence). For headache the results were inconsistent.Progressive computer glasses with far-distance focus in the upper part of the glasses versus other glassesOne study found no considerable difference in number of persons with asthenopia between progressive computer glasses with far-distance focus and bifocal computer glasses after four weeks' follow-up (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.50, very low quality evidence). The number of persons with headache, nausea and dizziness was also not different between groups.Another study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between progressive computer glasses with far-distance focus and monofocal computer glasses after one-year follow-up (MD change scores -1.79, 95% CI -11.60 to 8.02 on a 100 mm VAS scale, very low quality evidence). The effects on headaches were inconsistent.One study found no difference between progressive far-distance focus computer glasses and trifocal glasses in effect on eyestrain severity (MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.07, very low quality evidence) or on eyestrain frequency (MD -0.75, 95% CI -1.61 to 0.11, very low quality evidence).Progressive computer glasses versus ergonomic assessment with habitual (computer) glassesOne study found that computer glasses optimised for individual needs reduced asthenopia sum score more than an ergonomic assessment and habitual (computer) glasses (MD -8.9, 95% CI -16.47 to -1.33, scale 0 to 140, very low quality evidence) but there was no effect on the frequency of eyestrain (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.11, very low quality evidence).We rated the quality of the evidence as low or very low due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency in the results and imprecision. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low to very low quality evidence that providing computer users with progressive computer glasses does not lead to a considerable decrease in problems with the eyes or headaches compared to other computer glasses. Progressive computer glasses might be slightly better than progressive glasses for daily use in the short term but not in the intermediate term and there is no data on long-term follow-up. The quality of the evidence is low or very low and therefore we are uncertain about this conclusion. Larger studies with several hundreds of participants are needed with proper randomisation, validated outcome measurement methods, and longer follow-up of at least one year to improve the quality of the evidence.","['Heus, Pauline', 'Verbeek, Jos H', 'Tikka, Christina']","['Heus P', 'Verbeek JH', 'Tikka C']","['Cochrane Netherlands, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Room Str. 6.131, PO Box 85500, Utrecht, Netherlands, 3508 GA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,IM,,,,2018/04/11 06:00,2018/05/22 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD009877.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2018 Apr 10;4:CD009877. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009877.pub2.,,20180410,20180521,,,"['Asthenopia/etiology/*prevention & control', '*Computer Terminals', 'Ergonomics', '*Eyeglasses', 'Headache/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Refractive Errors/*therapy']",PMC6494484,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study design: A prospective clinical study. Methods: Twenty-eight patients (28 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma, who had used tafluprost and timolol gel for at least 3 months with good adherence, were enrolled. Concomitant administration of tafluprost and timolol was switched to TTFC without a washout period. The intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, pulse rate, and ocular signs were compared between before switching (baseline), and 4 and 8 weeks after switching. A questionnaire survey was also performed 4 weeks after switching to investigate ocular comfort and patient preferences. Results: The IOP showed no significant change after switching to TTFC (14.8 +/- 2.8, 14.6 +/- 3.4, and 14.8 +/- 3.7 mmHg at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8, respectively). The pulse rate and systolic blood pressure showed no changes, but diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower at Week 8. At baseline, fluorescein staining revealed corneal abnormalities in 3 patients, which resolved by Week 8 in 1 patient. Hyperemia was noted in 2 patients at baseline, and this also resolved by Week 8 in 1 patient. Three patients discontinued study treatment for the following reasons (1 patient each): blurred vision; ocular irritation, eyelid erythema, and asthenopia; and loss to follow-up from Week 8. The questionnaire survey revealed no significant differences between the 2 treatments, although more patients preferred TTFC. Conclusion: Among 28 patients enrolled, only 2 patients discontinued the study treatment due to adverse reactions. In patients whose adherence was considered relatively good to concomitant therapy, switching to TTFC achieved similar IOP control with good safety and a high level of patient acceptance.","['Inoue, Kenji', 'Kawashima, Taku', 'Katakura, Seiki', 'Shidara, Kyoko', 'Fujimoto, Takayuki', 'Kohmoto, Hiromi', 'Shiokawa, Minako', 'Moriyama, Ryo', 'Okayama, Ryoko']","['Inoue K', 'Kawashima T', 'Katakura S', 'Shidara K', 'Fujimoto T', 'Kohmoto H', 'Shiokawa M', 'Moriyama R', 'Okayama R']","['Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Clin Ophthalmol,"Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)",101321512,,['NOTNLM'],"['adverse reactions', 'intraocular pressure', 'switching', 'tafluprost', 'timolol fixed combination']","['Disclosure K Inoue: lecture fees (Santen, Alcon Japan, Otsuka, Pfizer, Senju,', 'Kowa), writing fees (Santen, Alcon Japan), and consulting fees (Santen, Alcon', 'Japan, Pfizer, Senju, Kowa, Kaken, Nitten).

DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. RESULTS: Two patients, a 26-year-old male and a 36-year-old female, diagnosed with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia presented with blepharoptosis and intermittent diplopia. Ocular motility examination was significant for bilateral profound impairment of adduction with relative preservation of abduction, infraduction and elevation. Control of intermittent exotropia gradually worsened over 3 and 1.5 years of follow-up, respectively, in the presence of documented stability of the angle of exodeviation. Strabismus surgery involving modest amounts of bilateral medial rectus resection and lateral rectus recessions was undertaken. Surgical intervention was successful in controlling alignment in primary position and alleviating diplopia and asthenopia after 9 and 8 years of follow-up time, respectively, despite slow progression of ophthalmoplegia. CONCLUSION: Bilateral selective impairment of adduction and intermittent exotropia may be the presenting ocular motility disturbance in chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Properly designed strabismus surgery may provide sustainable, in the midterm, control of alignment and symptomatic relief in selected patients with CPEO.","['Chatzistefanou, Klio I', 'Brouzas, Dimitrios', 'Asproudis, Ioannis', 'Tsina, Efthimia', 'Droutsas, Konstantinos D', 'Koutsandrea, Chryssanthi']","['Chatzistefanou KI', 'Brouzas D', 'Asproudis I', 'Tsina E', 'Droutsas KD', 'Koutsandrea C']","['Strabismus Service, First Department of Ophthalmology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, 32 Socratous Street, Voula, 16673, Athens, Greece. kliochat@med.uoa.gr.', 'Strabismus Service, First Department of Ophthalmology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, 32 Socratous Street, Voula, 16673, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Athens General Pediatric Hospital ""Aghia Sophia"", Athens, Greece.', 'Strabismus Service, First Department of Ophthalmology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, 32 Socratous Street, Voula, 16673, Athens, Greece.', 'Strabismus Service, First Department of Ophthalmology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, 32 Socratous Street, Voula, 16673, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Int Ophthalmol,International ophthalmology,7904294,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia', 'Diplopia management in CPEO', 'Strabismus surgery']",,2018/03/28 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2018/03/28 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10792-017-0781-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10792-017-0781-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int Ophthalmol. 2019 Jan;39(1):213-217. doi: 10.1007/s10792-017-0781-2.

Two conditions replicated the conventional monocular accommodative facility tests for far and near distances, performed with manually held flippers. The other three conditions were automated and conducted using an electro-optical system and open-field autorefractor. Two of the three automated conditions replicated the predictable manual accommodative facility tests. The last automated condition was a hybrid approach using a novel method whereby far and near-accommodative-facility tests were randomly integrated into a single test of four unpredictable accommodative demands. RESULTS: The within-subject standard deviations for far- and near-distance-accommodative reversals were (+/-1,+/-1) cycles per minute (cpm) for the manual flipper accommodative facility conditions and (+/-3, +/-4) cpm for the automated conditions. The 95% limits of agreement between the manual and the automated conditions for far and near distances were poor: (-18, 12) and (-15, 3). During the hybrid unpredictable condition, the response time and accommodative response parameters were significantly (p < 0.05) larger for accommodation than disaccommodation responses for high accommodative demands only. The response times during the transitions 0.17/2.17 D and 0.50/4.50 D appeared to be indistinguishable between the hybrid unpredictable and the conventional predictable automated tests. CONCLUSIONS: The automated accommodative facility test does not agree with the manual flipper test results. Operator delays in flipping the lens may account for these differences. This novel test, using unpredictable stimuli, provides a more comprehensive examination of accommodative dynamics than conventional manual accommodative facility tests. Unexpectedly, the unpredictability of the stimulus did not to affect accommodation dynamics. Further studies are needed to evaluate the sensitivity of this novel hybrid technique on individuals with accommodative anomalies.","['Otero, Carles', 'Aldaba, Mikel', 'Lopez, Silvia', 'Diaz-Douton, Fernando', 'Vera-Diaz, Fuensanta A', 'Pujol, Jaume']","['Otero C', 'Aldaba M', 'Lopez S', 'Diaz-Douton F', 'Vera-Diaz FA', 'Pujol J']","['a Davalor Research Center , Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya , Terrassa , Spain.', 'b Center for Sensors, Instruments and Systems Development , Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya , Terrassa , Spain.', 'a Davalor Research Center , Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya , Terrassa , Spain.', 'b Center for Sensors, Instruments and Systems Development , Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya , Terrassa , Spain.', 'c New England College of Optometry , Boston , MA , USA.', 'a Davalor Research Center , Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya , Terrassa , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Eye Res,Current eye research,8104312,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Accommodative facility', '*accommodative dynamics', '*automated test', '*unpredicted stimuli', '*visual fatigue']",,2018/03/01 06:00,2019/05/17 06:00,['2018/03/01 06:00'],"['2018/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/02713683.2018.1444181 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Eye Res. 2018 Jun;43(6):788-795. doi: 10.1080/02713683.2018.1444181.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed. Key words and Medical Subject Heading terms were used to generate refined queries with inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on fatigue and error. Results were selected according to these criteria: examined radiologist fatigue and radiologic error stemming from fatigue; experimental results measured as accuracy, error, or performance; and peer-reviewed publication. The risk of bias was addressed by including both quantitative and qualitative studies. RESULTS: Twenty-seven articles were included, mainly primary research articles. Common outcome measures included subjective self-reports and tests to measure eyestrain. Reaction time was also recorded, accounting for variables such as age and experience. One group recommended that guidelines should be implemented regarding number of hours worked. Most recommended ergonomic interventions, proposing the implementation of tools to measure and standardize fatigue and optimize workflow, in conjunction with considering radiologists individually. Education in appropriate viewing habits and breaks were also suggested. Only one study with seven participants recommended that radiologists should sleep well to improve their performance and overall well-being, despite the undeniable evidence that radiologists are fatigued. CONCLUSION: Fatigue is present in radiology and affects diagnostic accuracy.","['Stec, Nadia', 'Arje, Danielle', 'Moody, Alan R', 'Krupinski, Elizabeth A', 'Tyrrell, Pascal N']","['Stec N', 'Arje D', 'Moody AR', 'Krupinski EA', 'Tyrrell PN']","['1 Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, 263 McCaul St, 4th Fl, Rm 401F, Toronto, ON M5T 1W7, Canada.', '1 Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, 263 McCaul St, 4th Fl, Rm 401F, Toronto, ON M5T 1W7, Canada.', '1 Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, 263 McCaul St, 4th Fl, Rm 401F, Toronto, ON M5T 1W7, Canada.', '2 Department of Radiology & Imaging Sciences, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', '1 Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, 263 McCaul St, 4th Fl, Rm 401F, Toronto, ON M5T 1W7, Canada.', '3 Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

The current study aims to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of the developed warming moist chamber goggles (WMCGs) for VDT-associated DE patients. METHODS: In this prospective self-control study, 22 DE patients (22 eyes) working with VDTs over 4 h daily were enrolled and instructed to wear WMCGs for 15 min. Sodium hyaluronate (SH, 0.1%) eyedrops were applied as a control on another day on these same patients, however 4 subjects denied the eyedrop application. The symptomatology visual analog scale (VAS) score, tear meniscus height (TMH), noninvasive tear film break-up time (NI-BUT), tear film lipid layer thickness (LLT), and bulbar conjunctival redness were assessed with Keratograph 5 M at baseline, 5, 30 and 60 min after treatment. The WMCGs wearing comfort was also evaluated. RESULTS: The ocular discomfort evaluated by VAS decreased in the WMCGs group throughout 60 min (P<0.001), better than the control group levels (P </= 0.015). TMH, NI-BUT (including the first BUT and average BUT) increased than baseline level accross 60 min in the WMCG group (P </= 0.012), while those in the control group only showed temporary improvements in 5 min. LLT also increased obviously after WMCGs wear, while the change in the control group was nearly innoticeable. No adverse responses were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary use of the WMCGs is able to relieve ocular discomfort, and improves tear film stability in DE patients for at least 1 h, making it a promising alternative to other treatments.","['Ren, Yueping', 'Chen, Jie', 'Zheng, Qinxiang', 'Chen, Wei']","['Ren Y', 'Chen J', 'Zheng Q', 'Chen W']","[""School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan West Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325027, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan West Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325027, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan West Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325027, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan West Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325027, People's Republic of China. weichenmd@hotmail.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Ophthalmol,BMC ophthalmology,100967802,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Dry eye', 'Tear film', 'Video display terminal', 'Warming moist chamber goggles']",,2018/02/09 06:00,2018/02/17 06:00,['2018/02/09 06:00'],"['2017/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12886-018-0700-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12886-018-0700-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Ophthalmol. 2018 Feb 7;18(1):33. doi: 10.1186/s12886-018-0700-y.,,20180207,20180216,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology/*therapy', '*Computer Terminals', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/etiology/*therapy', 'Equipment Design', '*Eye Protective Devices', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Humidity', 'Lipid Metabolism/physiology', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tears/physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5803892,"['2016Y0681/research grants from Wenzhou Science and Technology Program', '2017KY489/Zhengjiang Medical Science and Technology Project']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of a binocular video game with a placebo video game for improving visual functions in older children and adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Binocular Treatment of Amblyopia Using Videogames clinical trial was a multicenter, double-masked, randomized clinical trial. Between March 2014 and June 2016, 115 participants 7 years and older with unilateral amblyopia (amblyopic eye visual acuity, 0.30-1.00 logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/40-20/200) due to anisometropia, strabismus, or both were recruited. Eligible participants were allocated with equal chance to receive either the active or the placebo video game, with minimization stratified by age group (child, age 7 to 12 years; teenager, age 13 to 17 years; and adult, 18 years and older). Interventions: Falling-blocks video games played at home on an iPod Touch for 1 hour per day for 6 weeks. The active video game had game elements split between eyes with a dichoptic contrast offset (mean [SD] initial fellow eye contrast, 0.23 [0.14]). The placebo video game presented identical images to both eyes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in amblyopic eye visual acuity at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included compliance, stereoacuity, and interocular suppression. Participants and clinicians who measured outcomes were masked to treatment allocation. Results: Of the 115 included participants, 65 (56.5%) were male and 83 (72.2%) were white, and the mean (SD) age at randomization was 21.5 (13.6) years. There were 89 participants (77.4%) who had prior occlusion. The mean (SD) amblyopic eye visual acuity improved 0.06 (0.12) logMAR from baseline in the active group (n = 56) and 0.07 (0.10) logMAR in the placebo group (n = 59). The mean treatment difference between groups, adjusted for baseline visual acuity and age group, was -0.02 logMAR (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02; P = .25). Compliance with more than 25% of prescribed game play was achieved by 36 participants (64%) in the active group and by 49 (83%) in the placebo group. At 6 weeks, 36 participants (64%) in the active group achieved fellow eye contrast greater than 0.9 in the binocular video game. No group differences were observed for any secondary outcomes. Adverse effects included 3 reports of transient asthenopia. Conclusions and Relevance: The specific home-based binocular falling-blocks video game used in this clinical trial did not improve visual outcomes more than the placebo video game despite increases in fellow eye contrast during game play. More engaging video games with considerations for compliance may improve effectiveness.

METHODS: Sixty-five patients of visual fatigue induced by the visual display terminal operation were treated with jingjin trigeminy therapy of Zhuang medicine, e.g. massage manipulation, acupuncture and cupping; acting on the specific stimulating areas in Zhuang medicine, relevant with orbit, temple, forehead, ear and Baihui (GV 20). Each treatment lasted 40 min, once every two or three days. Totally, 10 to 14 treatments were required. The scores of visual symptoms and the ocular hemodynamics before and after treatment were observed, and clinical effect were evaluated in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of visual symptoms were reduced apparently as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.05). The total effective rate was 84.6% (55/65).

The goal of this study was 1) to evaluate the impact of wearing VDU lenses on visual fatigue and self-reported neck pain and disability, compared to progressive lenses, and 2) to measure the effect of both lenses on head inclination and pressure pain thresholds during the performance of a VDU task. METHODS: Thirty-five eligible subjects were randomly assigned to wear progressive VDU lenses (VDU group) (n = 18) or progressive lenses (P group) (n = 17). They were enquired about visual complaints (VFQ), self-perceived pain (NRS) and disability (NDI) at baseline (with old lenses), and 1 week, 3 months and 6 months after wearing their new lenses. In addition, Forward Head Angle (FHA) and PPTs were assessed during and after a VDU task before and 6 months after wearing the new lenses. A short questionnaire concerning the satisfaction about the study lenses was completed at the end of the study. RESULTS: In both groups, visual fatigue and neck pain was decreased at 3 and 6 months follow up, compared to baseline. All PPTs were higher during the second VDU task, independent of the type of lenses. The VDU group reported a significantly higher suitability of the lenses for VDU work. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that there is little difference in effect of the different lenses on visual and musculoskeletal comfort. Lenses should be adjusted to the task-specific needs and habits of the participant.","['Cagnie, Barbara', 'De Meulemeester, Kayleigh', 'Saeys, Lieselotte', 'Danneels, Lieven', 'Vandenbulcke, Liesbet', 'Castelein, Birgit']","['Cagnie B', 'De Meulemeester K', 'Saeys L', 'Danneels L', 'Vandenbulcke L', 'Castelein B']","['Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy, Ghent University, De Pintelaan 185 3B3, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.

The experience of fatigue in pSS, and its relationship with sicca symptoms, is poorly understood. METHODS: Twenty people diagnosed with pSS were recruited to participate in a semi-structured qualitative interview about their symptoms experience. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: People with pSS described physical tiredness, mental fatigue and ocular fatigue. Mental fatigue was characterised by difficulties in attention, particularly, the ability to follow conversations and short-term memory problems. Participants linked their experience of fatigue to feeling of depression, frustration, irritation and anxiety, and therefore, fatigue was suggested to have had a large impact on their psychological well-being. People with pSS also described a range of ocular symptoms including pain, dryness, and itching, which were compounded by fatigue. For some, eye fatigue was pervasive, and daily activities involving the eyes such as reading, using the computer and driving were impaired. In some cases, the level of ocular discomfort was so severe it prevented sleep, which in turn impacted on general fatigue levels. CONCLUSIONS: People with pSS experience fatigue in a range of ways; physical, mental and ocular fatigue were described. Fatigue was suggested to exacerbate other ocular symptoms, posed serious physical limitations and caused psychological distress. Further research into the nature of fatigue and ocular symptoms in pSS is required.","['Stack, Rebecca J', 'Southworth, Sue', 'Fisher, Benjamin A', 'Barone, Francesca', 'Buckley, Christopher D', 'Rauz, Saaeha', 'Bowman, Simon J']","['Stack RJ', 'Southworth S', 'Fisher BA', 'Barone F', 'Buckley CD', 'Rauz S', 'Bowman SJ']","['Centre for Translational Inflammation Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Translational Inflammation Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Translational Inflammation Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Translational Inflammation Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Translational Inflammation Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Translational Inflammation Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Translational Inflammation Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Rheumatology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,,2017/11/01 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2017/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0187272 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-04518 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Oct 31;12(10):e0187272. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0187272. eCollection 2017.,,20171031,20171113,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asthenopia/*etiology', 'Fatigue/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Middle Aged', 'Qualitative Research', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/*complications"", 'Young Adult']",PMC5663496,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '21236/VAC_/Versus Arthritis/United Kingdom', 'MR/M009157/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was done with a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Four hundred and nine students participated; 78% were females. The mean age was 21.6 years. Neck pain (75.1%), eye strain (67%), shoulder pain (65.5%) and eye burn (61.9%) were the most common CVS symptoms. Dry eyes (26.2%), double vision (28.9%) and blurred vision (51.6%) were the least commonly experienced symptoms. Eye burning (P = .001), eye strain (P = .041) and neck pain (P = .023) were significantly related to level of viewing. Moderate eye burning (55.1%) and double vision (56%) occurred in those who used handheld devices (P = .001 and .007, respectively). Moderate blurred vision was reported in 52% who looked down at the device compared with 14.8% who held it at an angle. Severe eye strain occurred in 63% of those who looked down at a device compared with 21% who kept the device at eye level. Shoulder pain was not related to pattern of use. CONCLUSION: Ocular symptoms and neck pain were less likely if the device was held just below eye level.

METHODS: Sixty ametropia juveniles (aged range, 11-15y) were randomized into two groups: the test group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing blue-violet light filtering lenses; and the control group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing ordinary aspherical lenses. Baseline refractive power of the affected eyes and axial length of the two groups was recorded. After 1-year, the patients underwent contrast sensitivity (glare and non-glare under bright and dark conditions), accommodation-related testing, asthenopia questionnaire assessment, and adverse reaction questionnaire assessment. RESULTS: After 1y of wearing the filtering lenses, changes in refractive power and axial length were not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). Under bright conditions, the contrast sensitivities at low and medium-frequency grating (vision angles of 6.3 degrees , 4.0 degrees , and 2.5 degrees ) with glare in the test group were significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05), while the contrast sensitivity at low-frequency grating (vision angles of 6.3 degrees and 4.0 degrees ) in the absence of glare in the test group was higher than in the control group (P<0.05). Under glare and non-glare dark conditions, the contrast sensitivities of various frequencies in the test group did not show significant differences compared with those in the control group (P>0.05). In the test group, the amplitude of accommodation, accommodative lag, and accommodative sensitivity of patients wearing glasses for 6 and 12mo were significantly elevated (P<0.05), while the asthenopia gratings were significantly decreased (P<0.05). Nevertheless, in the control group, the amplitude of accommodation, accommodative lag, and accommodative sensitivity after 12mo were not significantly altered compared with baseline (P>0.05), and the asthenopia grating was not significantly decreased (P>0.05). In addition, after wearing glasses for 6 to 12mo, the asthenopia grating of patients in the test group decreased significantly compared with the control group (P<0.05). At 12mo, the constituent ratio of adverse reactions did not show significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: A 1-year follow-up reveal that compare with ordinary glasses, short-wavelength filtering lenses (blue/violet-light filters) increase the low- and medium-frequency contrast sensitivity under bright conditions and improved accommodation. They effectively relieved asthenopia without severe adverse reactions, suggesting potential for clinical application. However, no significant advantages in terms of refractive power or axial length progression were found compared with ordinary aspheric lenses.","['Zhao, Hai-Lan', 'Jiang, Jin', 'Yu, Jie', 'Xu, Hai-Ming']","['Zhao HL', 'Jiang J', 'Yu J', 'Xu HM']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang Province, China."", ""Department of Ophthalmology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang Province, China."", ""Department of Ophthalmology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang Province, China."", ""Department of Ophthalmology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang Province, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Int J Ophthalmol,International journal of ophthalmology,101553860,,['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'juvenile myopia', 'short-wavelength filtering lenses']",,2017/09/02 06:00,2017/09/02 06:01,['2017/09/02 06:00'],"['2017/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18240/ijo.2017.08.13 [doi]', 'ijo-10-08-1261 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Ophthalmol. 2017 Aug 18;10(8):1261-1267. doi: 10.18240/ijo.2017.08.13. eCollection 2017.,,20170818,,,,,PMC5554846,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tasks performed by ophthalmologists involve visual effort, raising interest in their study within the context of occupational health. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of visual complaints and its relationship to work demands among ophthalmologists at a university hospital in Lisbon. Methods: Occurrence of visual fatigue symptoms was assessed by means of a symptom questionnaire - College of Optometrists in Vision Development Quality of Life (COVD-QoL) - and through the identification of near points of accommodation and convergence. Schirmer's test was used to assess tear production. The results were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, Spearman's coefficient and the Wilcoxon test for p<0.05. Results: Most among the 27 analyzed physicians reported visual fatigue (n=25), dry eyes and frequent blinking (n=27). Schirmer's test evidenced differences at the end of the working day and the near points of accommodation and convergence indicated occurrence of visual fatigue. Conclusions: The results showed significant differences between the beginning and the end of the working day among ophthalmologists, with occurrence of visual fatigue at the end of the working day. These findings point to the need to implement a health surveillance program to prevent occupational visual disorders.","['Dzhodzhua, Viktoriya', 'Serranheira, Florentino', 'Leite, Ema Sacadura', 'Grillo, Manuel Monteiro', 'Uva, Antonio Sousa']","['Dzhodzhua V', 'Serranheira F', 'Leite ES', 'Grillo MM', 'Uva AS']","['National Public Health School - Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Center of Public Health Investigation (Centro de Investigacao em Saude Publica - CISP), National Public Health School, New University of Lisbon - Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Northern Lisbon Hospital Center - Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Northern Lisbon Hospital Center - Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Center of Public Health Investigation (Centro de Investigacao em Saude Publica - CISP), National Public Health School, New University of Lisbon - Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Rev Bras Med Trab,Revista brasileira de medicina do trabalho : publicacao oficial da Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho-ANAMT,101214718,,['NOTNLM'],"['occupational medicine', 'ophthalmology', 'visual fatigue']",,2017/09/01 00:00,2017/09/01 00:01,['2020/04/10 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5327/Z1679443520170013 [doi]'],epublish,Rev Bras Med Trab. 2017 Sep 1;15(3):209-216. doi: 10.5327/Z1679443520170013. eCollection 2017.,,20170901,,,,,PMC7104846,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study of a population of children using video games was employed. All patients between 3 and 10 years of age were recruited at an outpatient unit accredited by the Italian Regional Health Service. Three hundred twenty children (159 boys and 161 girls; mean age = 6.9 +/- 2 years) were observed. Ophthalmological examination included assessment of stereoscopic vision on Lang-Stereotests I and II (LANG-STEREOTEST AG, Kusnacht, Switzerland) and identification of the dominant eye using the Dolman method. Furthermore, a questionnaire was used to record asthenopic symptoms and daily exposure to video games and electronic screens. Two groups of children were examined according to the average amount of time spent playing video games daily: children who played video games for less than 30 minutes per day and not every day (control group) and children who played video games for 30 minutes or more every day (video game group). Both groups were then divided into two subgroups: children using other types of electronic screens (eg, televisions, computers, tablets, and smartphones) for less than 3 hours daily (low electronic use subgroup) and children using other types of electronic screens for 3 hours or more per day (high electronic use subgroup). RESULTS: Asthenopia (especially headache, eyelid tic, transient diplopia, and dizziness), absence of fine stereopsis, and refractive errors were statistically more frequent (mainly in the dominant eye) in children in the video game group. CONCLUSIONS: These symptoms were frequent and peculiar in the video game group and might be part of a video game vision syndrome that has not been defined yet. It is important to recognize these signs as possible functional disorders to avoid erroneous diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

The responses from 451 manufacturing employees were analyzed using descriptive data analysis, bivariate analysis and Market Basket Analysis. 57.9% of respondents indicated that they were somewhat fatigued during the past week. They reported the ankles/feet, lower back and eyes were frequently affected body parts and a lack of sleep, work stress and shift schedule were top selected root causes for fatigue. In order to respond to fatigue when it is present, respondents reported coping by drinking caffeinated drinks, stretching/doing exercises and talking with coworkers. Frequent combinations of fatigue causes and individual coping methods were identified. These results may inform the design of fatigue monitoring and mitigation strategies and future research related to fatigue development.","['Lu, Lin', 'Megahed, Fadel M', 'Sesek, Richard F', 'Cavuoto, Lora A']","['Lu L', 'Megahed FM', 'Sesek RF', 'Cavuoto LA']","['Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Auburn University, AL, 36849, USA.

METHODS: Seventy-three patients were included in this retrospective, cohort study. Patients were stratified into group 1 (35 with childhood-onset esotropia [CET]) and group 2 (38 with adult-onset esophoria-tropia [EPT]). Preoperative immediate, 2-week, and 4-6-month postoperative measurements of ocular alignment, as well as fusional testing, were performed. Postoperative success was defined as distant (6 m) and near (33 cm) alignment within 12 prism diopters (PDs) of orthotropia in the primary position at 2 weeks and at 4-6 months with a single surgery. RESULTS: Patients with CET more frequently had hyperopia and amblyopia and were more likely to present for surgery because of psychosocial strabismus-related problems. Patients with EPT predominantly had myopia and were more likely to experience diplopia and asthenopia. In group 1, the mean preoperative distance deviation improved from 30 PDs to 4 PDs at 2 weeks and to 4 PDs at 4-6 months (p < 0.001). In group 2, mean preoperative distance alignment improved from 22 to 3 PDs at 2 weeks and to 3 PDs at 4-6 months (p < 0.001). The mean objective, single-surgery success rate at 2 weeks was 88% and 97% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. At 4-6 months, postoperative success was 71% in group 1 and 80% in group 2. The majority of patients reported subjective improvement. CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct preoperative differences between CET and EPT patients. Adjustable, strabismus surgery in this cohort is safe and effective in achieving subjective and objective success.","['Mikhail, Mikel', 'Flanders, Michael']","['Mikhail M', 'Flanders M']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Que.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Que; Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Que..

To date, occupational exposure of workers suffering from myopic co-morbidities to fluorescence light is not clearly linked to a worsening of retinal damage and eye symptoms. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old pathologist, suffering from myopic retinopathy and other ocular comorbidities, asked for medical examination due to worsening vision and burning eyes, after occupational exposure to fluorescence microscope. Eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist detected a severe chorio-retinal atrophy in peri-papillar region and scotopic-photopic reduced voltages at electroretinogram. Moreover, a workplace inspection noted high light intensity from power source (9600 lux). Considering severity of the retinopathy, frequency of the ocular symptoms and steady occupational exposure both to low-intensity fluorescent light and high intensity light, we decided to declare the worker only fit for specific tasks which do not include the use of a fluorescence microscope. Almost six months later, the worker was recalled for a new examination and she reported the absence of the ocular discomfort that had led her to request the previous examination. CONCLUSION: In this unconventional case, we considered appropriated to use great caution, to avoid ocular fatigue and prevent possible retinal damage in the worker.","['Quarato, Marco', 'Gatti, Maria Franca', 'De Maria, Luigi', 'Caputi, Antonio', 'Fucilli, Fulvio Italo Maria', 'Vimercati, Luigi']","['Quarato M', 'Gatti MF', 'De Maria L', 'Caputi A', 'Fucilli FIM', 'Vimercati L']","['Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine, Occupational Medicine ""B.

We evaluated to what extent these instruments cover similar domains by identifying the underlying quality-of-life factors of the combined questionnaires. METHODS: Participants were adults from a historic cohort with available orthoptic childhood data documenting strabismus and/or amblyopia. They had previously completed the A&SQ and were now asked to complete the AS-20. Factor analysis was performed on the correlation-matrix of the combined AS-20 and A&SQ data to identify common underlying factors. The identified factors were correlated with the clinical variables of angle of strabismus, degree of binocular vision, and visual acuity of the worse eye. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients completed both questionnaires (mean age, 44 years; range, 38-51 years). Six factors were found that together explained 78% of the total variance. The factor structure was dominated by the first four factors. One factor contained psychosocial and social-contact items, and another factor depth-perception items from both questionnaires. A third factor contained seven items-only from the AS-20-on eye strain, stress, and difficulties with reading and with concentrating. A fourth factor contained seven items-only from the A&SQ-on fear of losing the better eye and visual disorientation, specific for amblyopia. Current visual acuity of the worse eye correlated with depth-perception items and vision-related items, whereas current binocular vision correlated with psychosocial and social-contact items, in 93 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggests that the AS-20 and A&SQ measure a similar psychosocial quality-of-life domain. However, functional problems like avoidance of reading, difficulty in concentrating, eye stress, reading problems, inability to enjoy hobbies, and need for frequent breaks when reading are represented only in the AS-20. During the development of the A&SQ, asthenopia items were considered insufficiently specific for strabismus and were excluded a priori. The patients who generated the items for the AS-20 had, in majority, adulthood-onset strabismus and diplopia and were, hence, more likely to develop such complaints than our adult patients with childhood-onset strabismus and/or amblyopia.","['van de Graaf, Elizabeth S', 'Borsboom, Gerard J J M', 'van der Sterre, Geertje W', 'Felius, Joost', 'Simonsz, Huibert J', 'Kelderman, Henk']","['van de Graaf ES', 'Borsboom GJJM', 'van der Sterre GW', 'Felius J', 'Simonsz HJ', 'Kelderman H']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Retina Foundation of the Southwest, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. simonsz@compuserve.com.', 'Department of Social Sciences, University of Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,8205248,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult strabismus', 'Clinical validation', 'Factor analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/04/28 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00417-017-3694-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00417-017-3694-x [pii]']",ppublish,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2017 Sep;255(9):1851-1858. doi: 10.1007/s00417-017-3694-x.

In order to find better ways to prevent and manage workers' headache, this study aimed to investigate the effects of occupational noise and vibration exposure on headache/eyestrain. METHODS: We used data from the fourth Korean Working Condition Survey (2014). After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25,751 workers were included. Occupational noise and vibration exposure and the prevalence of headache/eyestrain were investigated by self-reported survey. Chi-square tests were used to compare differences in baseline characteristics between the group with headache/eyestrain and the group without. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a logistic regression model adjusted for several covariates. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) analysis was used to evaluate the effect of occupational noise and/or vibration exposure. RESULTS: Among the 25,751 study subjects, 4,903 had experienced headache/eyestrain in the preceding year. There were significant differences in age, education level, household income, occupational classification, shift work, occupational vibration exposure, and occupational noise exposure between the two groups (all p<0.05). The odds ratios between each exposure and headache/eyestrain increased proportionally with the level of exposure, increasing from 1.08 to 1.26 with increasing vibration exposure, and from 1.25 to 1.41 with increasing noise exposure. According to the AUROC analysis, the predictive power of each exposure was significant, and increased when the two exposures were considered in combination. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study show that both occupational noise and vibration exposures are associated with headache/eyestrain; noise exposure more strongly so. However, when the two exposures are considered in combination, the explanatory power for headache/eyestrain is increased. Therefore, efforts aimed at reducing and managing occupational noise and vibration exposure are crucial to maintaining workers' health.","['Kim, Jihyun', 'Lee, Wanhyung', 'Won, Jong-Uk', 'Yoon, Jin-Ha', 'Seok, Hongdeok', 'Kim, Yeong-Kwang', 'Lee, Seunghyun', 'Roh, Jaehoon']","['Kim J', 'Lee W', 'Won JU', 'Yoon JH', 'Seok H', 'Kim YK', 'Lee S', 'Roh J']","['The Institute for Occupational Health, University College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Public Health, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Incheon Worker's Health Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'The Institute for Occupational Health, University College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Public Health, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Incheon Worker's Health Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'The Institute for Occupational Health, University College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Public Health, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Incheon Worker's Health Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'The Institute for Occupational Health, University College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Public Health, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Incheon Worker's Health Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'The Institute for Occupational Health, University College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Public Health, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Incheon Worker's Health Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'The Institute for Occupational Health, University College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Public Health, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Incheon Worker's Health Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'The First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'The Institute for Occupational Health, University College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Public Health, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Incheon Worker's Health Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0177846 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-36085 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 May 23;12(5):e0177846. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177846. eCollection 2017.,,20170523,20170918,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Area Under Curve', 'Asthenopia/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Headache/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Noise, Occupational/statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prevalence', 'ROC Curve', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Vibration', 'Young Adult']",PMC5441589,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4228-7209'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a 3D flexible endoscope and conducted a feasibility study of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in porcine stomach. METHODS: Four endoscopists used a 3D flexible endoscope to perform a total of 8 ESD procedures on resected porcine stomachs. We assessed the en bloc resection rate, perforation rate, and mechanical issues that arise during ESD. A visual analog scale (0, 2D superior; 100, 3D superior) was used to evaluate the depth perception, sense of security of the procedure, and eyestrain of 3D visualization. RESULTS: En bloc resection was achieved in all cases and there were no cases of perforation or mechanical issues. Depth perception and sense of security were rated 85.5 +/- 12.4 and 70.7 +/- 9.7 respectively (mean +/- SDs). Eyestrain was rated high for 3D visualization (mean +/- SDs, 12.6 +/- 8.6). CONCLUSIONS: ESD using a 3D flexible endoscope was technically feasible. The endoscopists reported good depth perception and a high sense of security when using 3D visualization but also noted strong eyestrain.","['Kikuchi, Daisuke', 'Kaise, Mitsuru', 'Nomura, Kosuke', 'Toba, Takahito', 'Kuribayashi, Yasutaka', 'Tanaka, Masami', 'Yamashita, Satoshi', 'Furuhata, Tsukasa', 'Matsui, Akira', 'Mitani, Toshifumi', 'Hoteya, Shu', 'Iizuka, Toshiro']","['Kikuchi D', 'Kaise M', 'Nomura K', 'Toba T', 'Kuribayashi Y', 'Tanaka M', 'Yamashita S', 'Furuhata T', 'Matsui A', 'Mitani T', 'Hoteya S', 'Iizuka T']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Digestion,Digestion,0150472,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Endoscopic procedure', 'Endoscopy', 'Eyestrain', 'Gastric cancer', 'Gastrointestinal endoscopy', 'Laparoscopy', 'Three-dimensional images']",,2017/04/04 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2017/04/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['000468924 [pii]', '10.1159/000468924 [doi]']",ppublish,Digestion. 2017;95(3):237-241. doi: 10.1159/000468924.

It is considered that reduction of melatonin secretion under the blue light exposure from smart-phone displays is one of the causes. The viewing distance may cause sleep disturbance, because the viewing distance determines the screen illuminance and/or asthenopia. However, to date, there has been no study closely investigating the impact of viewing distance on sleep; therefore, we sought to determine the relationship between smartphone viewing distance and subjective sleep status. Twenty-three nursing students (mean age +/- standard deviation of 19.7+/-3.1 years) participated in the study. Subjective sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, morningness-eveningness questionnaire, and the Epworth sleepiness scale. We used the distance between the head and the hand while holding a smartphone to measure the viewing distance while using smartphones in sitting and lying positions. The distance was calculated using the three-dimensional coordinates obtained by a noncontact motion-sensing device. The viewing distance of smartphones in the sitting position ranged from 13.3 to 32.9 cm among participants. In the lying position, it ranged from 9.9 to 21.3cm. The viewing distance was longer in the sitting position than in the lying position (mean +/- standard deviation: 20.3+/-4.7 vs 16.4+/-2.7, respectively, P<0.01). We found that the short viewing distance in the lying position had a positive correlation to a poorer sleep state (R(2)=0.27, P<0.05), lower sleep efficiency (R(2)=0.35, P<0.05), and longer sleep latency (R(2)=0.38, P<0.05). Moreover, smartphone viewing distances in lying position correlated negatively with subjective sleep status. Therefore, when recommending ideal smartphone use in lying position, one should take into account the viewing distances.","['Yoshimura, Michitaka', 'Kitazawa, Momoko', 'Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Mimura, Masaru', 'Tsubota, Kazuo', 'Kishimoto, Taishiro']","['Yoshimura M', 'Kitazawa M', 'Maeda Y', 'Mimura M', 'Tsubota K', 'Kishimoto T']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo; RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, Wako, Saitama; Department of Nursing, Aino University Junior College.', 'RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, Wako, Saitama.', 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo.', 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Psychiatry, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Nat Sci Sleep,Nature and science of sleep,101537767,,['NOTNLM'],"['blue light', 'distance', 'sleep', 'smartphone']","['Disclosure Taishiro Kishimoto has received consultant fees from Dainippon', ""Sumitomo, Novartis, and Otsuka and has received speaker's honoraria from Banyu,"", 'Eli Lilly, Dainippon Sumitomo, Janssen, Novartis, Otsuka, and Pfizer, outside the', 'submitted work.

By using a slow event-related paradigm, the oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) responses to fused binocular stimuli presented by the random-dot stereogram (RDS) were recorded over the whole visual dorsal area. To extract from an HbO curve the characteristics that are correlated with subjective experiences of stereopsis and visual fatigue, we proposed a novel method to fit the time-course HbO curve with various response functions which could reflect various processes of binocular depth perception. Our results indicate that the parietal-occipital cortices are spatially correlated with binocular depth perception and that the process of depth perception includes two steps, associated with generating and sustaining stereovision. Visual fatigue is caused mainly by generating stereovision, while the amplitude of the haemodynamic response corresponding to sustaining stereovision is correlated with stereopsis. Combining statistical parameter analysis and the fitted time-course analysis, fNIRS could be a promising method to study visual fatigue and possibly other multi-process neural bases.","['Cai, Tingting', 'Zhu, Huilin', 'Xu, Jie', 'Wu, Shijing', 'Li, Xinge', 'He, Sailing']","['Cai T', 'Zhu H', 'Xu J', 'Wu S', 'Li X', 'He S']","['Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, South China Academy of Advanced Optoelectronics, South China Normal University (SCNU), Guangzhou, China.', 'Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, South China Academy of Advanced Optoelectronics, South China Normal University (SCNU), Guangzhou, China.', 'Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, South China Academy of Advanced Optoelectronics, South China Normal University (SCNU), Guangzhou, China.', 'Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, South China Academy of Advanced Optoelectronics, South China Normal University (SCNU), Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Information and Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, South China Normal University (SCNU), Guangzhou, China.', 'Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, South China Academy of Advanced Optoelectronics, South China Normal University (SCNU), Guangzhou, China.', 'South China Normal University (SCNU), Guangzhou, China.', 'Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, South China Academy of Advanced Optoelectronics, South China Normal University (SCNU), Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Electromagnetic Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,,2017/02/17 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2017/02/17 06:00'],"['2016/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0172426 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-42235 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 16;12(2):e0172426. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0172426. eCollection 2017.,,20170216,20170901,['0 (Oxyhemoglobins)'],,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', '*Depth Perception', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Oxyhemoglobins/metabolism', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared/*methods', '*Vision, Binocular', 'Visual Cortex/*physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5312944,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each participant completed two 15-min visual search task sets at each curvature setting. The 600-mm and 1200-mm settings yielded better results than the flat setting in terms of legibility and perceived visual fatigue. Relative to the corresponding centre zone, the outermost zones of the 1200-mm and flat settings showed a decrease of 8%-37% in legibility, whereas those of the flat setting showed an increase of 26%-45% in perceived visual fatigue. Across curvatures, legibility decreased by 2%-8%, whereas perceived visual fatigue increased by 22% during the second task set. The two task sets induced an increase of 102% in the eye complaint score and a decrease of 0.3 Hz in the critical fusion frequency, both of which indicated an increase in visual fatigue.

Among ocular causes, asthenopia was a major entity as 62(16.36%) asthenopic patients presented with refractive errors. These were followed by presbyopics who presented with complaint of headache 56(14.78%). The number of computer users with similar complaint was 18(4.76%). Among other ocular causes of headache, the number of patients with corneal ulcers was 22(5.80%), glaucoma 15(3.96%) and endophthalmitis 4(1.06%). Among the non-ocular causes were hypertension 59(15.57%), sinusitis 41(10.82%) and migraine 47(12.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had associate ocular causes such as refractive errors and anterior segment pathologies.","['Fasih, Uzma', 'Shaikh, Arshad', 'Shaikh, Nisar']","['Fasih U', 'Shaikh A', 'Shaikh N']","['Eye Department, Karachi Medical & Dental College, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Karachi.', 'Eye Department, Karachi Medical & Dental College, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Karachi.', 'Eye Department, Liaquat College of Medicine and Dentistry, Dar-u-Sehat Hospital, Karachi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

Methods: A total of 36 healthy subjects (20 male; 16 female) was randomized to wearing no-block, low-blocking, or high-blocking eyeglasses while performing a 2-hour computer task. A masked grader measured critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) as a metric of eye fatigue and evaluated symptoms of eye strain with a 15-item questionnaire before and after computer use. Results: We found that the change in CFF after the computer task was significantly more positive (i.e., less eye fatigue) in the high-block versus the no-block (P = 0.027) and low-block (P = 0.008) groups. Moreover, random assignment to the high-block group but not to the low-block group predicted a more positive change in CFF (i.e., less eye fatigue) following the computer task (adjusted beta = 2.310; P = 0.002). Additionally, subjects wearing high-blocking eyeglasses reported significantly less feeling pain around/inside the eye (P = 0.0063), less feeling that the eyes were heavy (P = 0.0189), and less feeling that the eyes were itchy (P = 0.0043) following the computer task, when compared to subjects not wearing high-blocking lenses. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that short-wavelength light-blocking eyeglasses may reduce eye strain associated with computer use based on a physiologic correlate of eye fatigue and on subjects' reporting of symptoms typically associated with eye strain.","['Lin, Jonathan B', 'Gerratt, Blair W', 'Bassi, Carl J', 'Apte, Rajendra S']","['Lin JB', 'Gerratt BW', 'Bassi CJ', 'Apte RS']","['Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States 2Neuroscience Graduate Program, Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'College of Optometry, University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'College of Optometry, University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States 4Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States 5Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,IM,,,,2017/01/25 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2017/01/25 06:00'],"['2017/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['2599717 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.16-20663 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2017 Jan 1;58(1):442-447. doi: 10.1167/iovs.16-20663.,,,20170623,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*therapy', 'Computer Terminals', 'Equipment Design', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Flicker Fusion/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Light/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Visual Acuity', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are common among computer (especially female) users. Laptops have surpassed desktop computer sales, and working with multiple monitors has also become popular. However, few studies have provided objective evidence on how they affect the musculoskeletal system in both genders. METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy participants (mean age = 24.6 years; 13 males) completed a 90-minute computer task while using a laptop or dual monitor (DualMon) desktop. Electromyography (EMG) from eight upper body muscles and visual strain were measured throughout the task. Neck proprioception was tested before and after the computer task using a head-repositioning test. EMG amplitude (root mean square [RMS]), variability (coefficients of variation [CV]), and normalized mutual information (NMI) were computed. RESULTS: Visual strain ( p < .01) and right upper trapezius RMS ( p = .03) increased significantly over time regardless of workstation. Right cervical erector spinae RMS and cervical NMI were smaller, while degrees of overshoot (mean = 4.15 degrees ) and end position error (mean = 1.26 degrees ) were larger in DualMon regardless of time. Effects on muscle activity were more pronounced in males, whereas effects on proprioception were more pronounced in females. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that compared to laptop, DualMon work is effective in reducing cervical muscle activity, dissociating cervical connectivity, and maintaining more typical neck repositioning patterns, suggesting some health-protective effects. APPLICATION: This evidence could be considered when deciding on computer workstation designs.","['Farias Zuniga, Amanda M', 'Cote, Julie N']","['Farias Zuniga AM', 'Cote JN']","['McGill University, Montreal, and Jewish Rehabilitation Hospital, Laval, Canada.', 'McGill University, Montreal, and Jewish Rehabilitation Hospital, Laval, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Factors,Human factors,0374660,IM S,['NOTNLM'],"['*electromyography', '*functional connectivity', '*gender', '*proprioception', '*visual strain']",,2017/01/07 06:00,2018/03/13 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0018720816684690 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Factors. 2017 Jun;59(4):546-563. doi: 10.1177/0018720816684690.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in nine counties of the southeast region of Brazil, using a systematic sampling of households, between March 2004 and July 2005. The population was defined as individuals aged between 1 and 96y, inhabitants of 3600 residences to be evaluated and 3012 households were included, corresponding to 8010 subjects considered for participation in the survey, of whom 7654 underwent ophthalmic examinations. The individuals were evaluated according their demographic data, eye complaints and eye examination including the RE and the need to prescribe spectacles according to age. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software package and descriptive analysis using 95% confidence intervals (P<0.05). RESULTS: The main symptom detected was asthenopia, most frequent in the 2(nd) and 3(rd) decades of life, with a significant decline after the 4(th) decade. Astigmatism was the RE most associated with asthenopia. Reduced near vision sight was more frequent in those >/=40y with a progressive decline thereafter. Spectacles were most frequently required in subjects of >/=40 years of age. CONCLUSION: The main symptom related to the vision was asthenopia and was associated to astigmatism. The greatest need for spectacles prescription occurred after 40's, mainly to correct near vision. Subjects of >/=40 years old were determined to be at high risk of uncorrected REs. These observations can guide intervention programs for the Brazilian population.","['Schellini, Silvana', 'Ferraz, Fabio', 'Opromolla, Paula', 'Oliveira, Laryssa', 'Padovani, Carlos']","['Schellini S', 'Ferraz F', 'Opromolla P', 'Oliveira L', 'Padovani C']","['Botucatu Medical School, University of State of Sao Paulo, Botucatu 18618-970, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Botucatu Medical School, University of State of Sao Paulo, Botucatu 18618-970, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Botucatu Medical School, University of State of Sao Paulo, Botucatu 18618-970, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Botucatu Medical School, University of State of Sao Paulo, Botucatu 18618-970, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Botucatu Medical School, University of State of Sao Paulo, Botucatu 18618-970, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Int J Ophthalmol,International journal of ophthalmology,101553860,,['NOTNLM'],"['population study', 'refractive error', 'spectacle need', 'visual symptoms']",,2016/12/19 06:00,2016/12/19 06:01,['2016/12/20 06:00'],"['2015/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18240/ijo.2016.11.20 [doi]', 'ijo-09-11-1657 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Ophthalmol. 2016 Nov 18;9(11):1657-1662. doi: 10.18240/ijo.2016.11.20. eCollection 2016.,,20161118,,,,,PMC5145097,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As medical image interpretation is highly dependent on visual input, visual fatigue is of particular interest to radiologists. Humans analyze their surroundings with rapid eye movements called saccades, and fatigue decreases saccadic velocity. Oculomotor parameters may, therefore, be an objective and reproducible metric of fatigue and eye movement analysis can provide valuable insight into the etiology of fatigue-related error.","['Waite, Stephen', 'Kolla, Srinivas', 'Jeudy, Jean', 'Legasto, Alan', 'Macknik, Stephen L', 'Martinez-Conde, Susana', 'Krupinski, Elizabeth A', 'Reede, Deborah L']","['Waite S', 'Kolla S', 'Jeudy J', 'Legasto A', 'Macknik SL', 'Martinez-Conde S', 'Krupinski EA', 'Reede DL']","['Department of Radiology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York.

A recent review supports the existence of VS and its treatment, but noted that controversy remains, in part due to inconsistencies in the diagnosis of the condition. The present paper reviews the diagnostic criteria for VS in the literature and reports a Delphi analysis of the criteria currently used in clinical practice. METHODS: Twenty-six eyecare practitioners were invited to participate in a Delphi study. They were selected because they were frequent prescribers of precision tinted lenses. In the first round they were sent a list of the indicators for which there is literature to suggest a relevance in the diagnosis of VS. The practitioners were invited to rank the indicators and add any additional criteria they use in diagnosis. In the second round a revised list was circulated, including items added from the responses in the first round. RESULTS: The respondents included optometrists, orthoptists and opticians. In the first round the response rate was 85%. Ninety-one percent of those who participated in the first round also responded in the second round. Strong indicators in the second round included the symptom of words moving when reading, voluntary use of an overlay for a prolonged period, improved performance of >/=15% with an overlay on the Wilkins Rate of Reading test, and an abnormally high score on the Pattern Glare Test. CONCLUSIONS: The strongest diagnostic criteria are combined in a diagnostic tool. This is proposed as a guide for clinical practice and further research.","['Evans, Bruce J W', 'Allen, Peter M', 'Wilkins, Arnold J']","['Evans BJW', 'Allen PM', 'Wilkins AJ']","['Institute of Optometry, London, UK; Division of Optometry & Visual Science, City, University London, UK.

METHODS: A survey related to common asthenopic (eyestrain) symptoms was administered to subjects before and after they read an extract from a novel on a smartphone for 60 minutes. Subjects rated their symptoms on a scale from zero (not at all) to four (extremely). The viewing distance to the smartphone was measured on a photograph taken of the subject every minute. Each subject used the same smartphone and read the same text. RESULTS: Subjects were 18 young adults (mean age: 21.5 +/- 3.3 years) with self-reported good health, normal visual acuity and no accommodative or binocular vision disorders. The mean viewing distance while using a smartphone over 60 minutes was 29.2 +/- 7.3 cm. The viewing distance was significantly greater during the first, second and fifth 10-minute time periods (30.6 +/- 7.2 cm, 29.7 +/- 7.3 cm and 28.9 +/- 8.5 cm, respectively) than during the final 10-minute time period (27.8 +/- 7.7 cm) (Wilcoxon, p = 0.023, 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). The total symptom score was significantly greater post-experiment (score = 8.06) than pre-experiment (score = 3.56) (Wilcoxon, p < 0.001). Symptoms of tired eyes, uncomfortable eyes and blur increased significantly after 60 minutes of smartphone use (Wilcoxon, p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between change in total symptom score and change in viewing distance (rho = -0.51; p = 0.03). The only single symptom that correlated with a change in viewing distance was 'uncomfortable eyes' (rho = -0.52, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Viewing distances are closer and eyestrain symptoms are greater after reading from a smartphone for 60 minutes.

METHODS: Twenty normal healthy adults (8 men, 12 women; mean age, 26.2 +/- 2.5 years) prospectively watched five types of monitors including flat, 4000R, 3000R, 2000R, and 1000R curved monitors for 30 min. An experienced examiner measured the ophthalmological factors including near point of accommodation (NPA), near point of convergence (NPC), refraction, parameters during pupil response at light and saccadic movement just before and after the visual tasks. The questionnaires about subjective ocular symptoms were also investigated just before and after the visual tasks. RESULTS: The NPA increased after the visual tasks with a flat monitor compared with the curved monitors, with the 1000R curved monitor showing the smallest change (p = 0.020). The NPC increased for every monitor after the visual tasks; the largest increase occurred with the flat monitor (p = 0.001). There was no difference in refractive error, pupil response, or saccadic movement in the comparison of before and after the visual tasks. Among the nine factors in the questionnaire, the score of ""eye pain"" was significantly higher for the flat monitor versus the 1000R curved monitor after the visual tasks (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: We identified NPA, NPC, and eye pain as factors associated with visual fatigue. Also, the curvature of the monitor was related to the visual fatigue.","['Lee, Haeng Jin', 'Kim, Seong-Joon']","['Lee HJ', 'Kim SJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Seoul Artificial Eye Center, Seoul National University Hospital Clinical Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/10/05 06:00,2017/06/20 06:00,['2016/10/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0164022 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-20417 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Oct 4;11(10):e0164022. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0164022. eCollection 2016.,,20161004,20170619,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Visual Acuity', 'Young Adult']",PMC5049768,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested two types of models for predicting visual fatigue in a task in which subjects were instructed to discriminate between 3D characters. One model was based on viewing distance (focal distance, vergence distance) and another in visual direction (oculomotor imbalance). METHOD: A 3D test was designed to assess binocular visual fatigue while looking at 3D stimuli located in different visual directions and viewed from two distances from the screen. The observers were tested under three conditions: (a) normal vision; (b) wearing a lens (-2 diop.); (c) wearing a base-out prism (2triangle down) over each eye. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated (as Signal Detection Theory parameters: SDT). RESULTS: An ANOVA and SDT analyses revealed that impaired visual performance were directly related to short distance and larger deviation in visual direction, particularly when the stimuli were located nearer and at more than 24 degrees to the centre of the screen in dextroversion and beyond. CONCLUSION: This results support a mixed model, combining a model based on the visual angle (related to viewing distance) and another based on the oculomotor imbalance (related to visual direction). This mixed model could help to predict the distribution of seats in the cinema room ranging from those that produce greater visual comfort to those that produce more visual discomfort. Also could be a first step to pre-diagnosis of binocular vision disorders.","['Aznar-Casanova, J Antonio', 'Romeo, August', 'Gomez, Aurora Torrents', 'Enrile, Pedro Martin']","['Aznar-Casanova JA', 'Romeo A', 'Gomez AT', 'Enrile PM']","['Faculty of Psychology, University of Barcelona, Spain; Institute for Brain, Cognition & Behavior (IR3 C), Spain.

METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and parallel study (Trial registration number: 2013-95). A total 60 volunteers were randomized into DA9301 (n = 30) and control (n = 30) groups. The DA9301 group received DA9301 oral pill (1000 mg/day) for 4 weeks and the control group received placebo. Asthenopia was evaluated by administering a questionnaire containing 10 questions (responses were scored on a scales of 0-6; total score: 60) regarding ocular symptoms before (baseline) and 4 weeks after receiving pills (DA9301 or placebo). The participants completed the questionnaire before and after tablet computer (iPad Air, Apple Inc.) watching at each visit. The change in total asthenopia score (TAS) was calculated and compared between the groups RESULTS: TAS increased significantly after tablet computer watching at baseline in DA9301 group. (from 20.35 to 23.88; p = 0.031) However, after receiving DA9301 for 4 weeks, TAS remained stable after tablet computer watching. In the control group, TAS changes induced by tablet computer watching were not significant both at baseline and at 4 weeks after receiving placebo. Further analysis revealed the scores for ""tired eyes"" (p = 0.001), ""sore/aching eyes"" (p = 0.038), ""irritated eyes"" (p = 0.010), ""watery eyes"" (p = 0.005), ""dry eyes"" (p = 0.003), ""eye strain"" (p = 0.006), ""blurred vision"" (p = 0.034), and ""visual discomfort"" (p = 0.018) significantly improved in the DA9301 group. CONCLUSIONS: We found that oral intake of DA9301 (1000 mg/day for 4 weeks) was effective in alleviating asthenopia symptoms induced by tablet computer watching.

There are no studies in the literature quantifying the incidence or severity of eyestrain, nor are there clinical characteristics that may predispose to these symptoms with e-reader use. PURPOSE: The primary objective of this pilot study was to assess the degree of eyestrain associated with e-reader use compared to traditional paper format. The secondary outcomes of this study were to assess the rate of eyestrain associated with e-reader use and identify any clinical characteristics that may be associated with the development of eyestrain. METHODS: Forty-four students were randomly assigned to study (e-reader iPAD) and control (print) groups. Participant posture, luminosity of the room, and reading distance from reading device were measured during a 1-h session for both groups. At the end of the session, questionnaires were administered to determine symptoms. RESULTS: Significantly higher rates of eyestrain (p = 0.008) and irritation (p = 0.011) were found among the iPAD study group as compared to the print 'control' group. The study group was also 4.9 times more likely to report severe eyestrain (95 % CI [1.4, 16.9]). No clinical characteristics predisposing to eyestrain could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: These findings conclude that reading on e-readers may induce increased levels of irritation and eyestrain. Predisposing factors, etiology, and potential remedial interventions remain to be determined.","['Maducdoc, Marlon M', 'Haider, Asghar', 'Nalbandian, Angele', 'Youm, Julie H', 'Morgan, Payam V', 'Crow, Robert W']","['Maducdoc MM', 'Haider A', 'Nalbandian A', 'Youm JH', 'Morgan PV', 'Crow RW']","['Irvine School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Louisiana State University-Ochsner Eye Center, New Orleans, LA, 70112, USA.', 'School of Medicine Irvine, Discovery Eye Foundation, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA.', 'Irvine School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, 850 Health Sciences Road, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, 850 Health Sciences Road, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA. rcrow@uci.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Netherlands,Int Ophthalmol,International ophthalmology,7904294,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Electronic readers and tablets', 'Eyestrain', 'Ocular complaints']",,2016/08/09 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2016/08/07 06:00'],"['2015/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10792-016-0281-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10792-016-0281-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int Ophthalmol. 2017 Apr;37(2):433-439. doi: 10.1007/s10792-016-0281-9.

Some claims, for example, that more than 10% of the general population and 50% of people with dyslexia would benefit from coloured filters lack sound evidence and face validity. Publications with such claims typically cite research using methods that have not been described in the scientific literature and lack a sound aetiological framework. Notwithstanding these criticisms, some researchers have used more rigorous selection criteria and methods of prescribing coloured filters that were developed at a UK Medical Research Council unit and which have been fully described in the scientific literature. We review this research and disconfirm many of the more extreme claims surrounding this topic. This literature indicates that a minority subset of dyslexics (circa 20%) may have a condition described as visual stress which most likely results from a hyperexcitability of the visual cortex. Visual stress is characterised by symptoms of visual perceptual distortions, headaches, and eyestrain when viewing repetitive patterns, including lines of text. This review indicates that visual stress is distinct from, although sometimes co-occurs with, dyslexia. Individually prescribed coloured filters have been shown to improve reading performance in people with visual stress, but are unlikely to influence the phonological and memory deficits associated with dyslexia and therefore are not a treatment for dyslexia. This review concludes that larger and rigorous randomised controlled trials of interventions for visual stress are required. Improvements in the diagnosis of the condition are also a priority.","['Evans, Bruce J W', 'Allen, Peter M']","['Evans BJ', 'Allen PM']","['Institute of Optometry, London, UK.

METHODS: One hundred and sixteen VDU users with flat-panel display from an urban population participated in the study; their ages ranging from 20 to 34y. There were 60 females and 56 males. An eye examination to rule out the presence of significant uncorrected refractive errors, general binocular dysfunctions and eye conditions was carried out. In order to determine and quantify the type and nature of eye symptoms, participants were asked to answer written questionnaire and the results were grouped by gender, age and number of hours a day spent using a VDU. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of participants reported eye symptoms related to VDU use. Eye symptoms from moderate-to-severe were found in 23% of participants. The main symptom was moderate-to-severe tired eyes (14%); followed by sensitivity to bright lights (12%), blurred vision at far distances (10%), eyestrain or dry eye or irritated or burning eyes (9%), difficulty in refocusing from one distance to another or headache (8%) and blurred vision at near or intermediate distances (<4%). Eye symptoms were greater among females (P=0.005) and increased with VDU use, markedly above 6h spent using a VDU in a typical day (P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Significant eye symptoms relate to VDU use often occur and should not be underestimated. The increasing use of electronic devices with flat-panel display should prompt users to take appropriate measures to prevent or to relieve the eye symptoms arising from their use.","['Porcar, Esteban', 'Pons, Alvaro M', 'Lorente, Amalia']","['Porcar E', 'Pons AM', 'Lorente A']","['Department of Optics, Optometry and Vision Science Unit, Physics College, University of Valencia, Burjassot, Valencia 46100, Spain.', 'Department of Optics, Optometry and Vision Science Unit, Physics College, University of Valencia, Burjassot, Valencia 46100, Spain.', 'Department of Optics II, Optometry College, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid 28040, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Int J Ophthalmol,International journal of ophthalmology,101553860,,['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'computer terminals', 'computer vision syndrome', 'eye symptoms']",,2016/07/02 06:00,2016/07/02 06:01,['2016/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18240/ijo.2016.06.16 [doi]', 'ijo-09-06-881 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Ophthalmol. 2016 Jun 18;9(6):881-5. doi: 10.18240/ijo.2016.06.16. eCollection 2016.,,20160618,20160701,,,,PMC4916147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients aged 6-12 years with abnormal binocularity, including strabismus, amblyopia, and anisometropia, were included. Age-matched normal subjects without any ophthalmologic abnormality other than a refractive error were also recruited. The best-corrected visual acuity, refractive error, angle of strabismus, and stereopsis were measured. Presenting visual acuity (PVA) was measured as the uncorrected visual acuity for subjects without glasses and spectacle-corrected visual acuity for those with glasses. After watching 3D TV for 30 min, a survey was administered to evaluate the 3D perception and 3D asthenopia. Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the survey for detecting abnormal binocularity and poor PVA. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were enrolled in this study. Among them, 59 had abnormal binocularity (strabismus, anisometropia, or amblyopia), and 41 were normal control. Among the entire subjects, the number of subjects with a PVA of 20/40 or worse in one or both eyes was 24 (7 from the normal control and 17 with abnormal binocularity). ROC curve analysis revealed that the survey did not effectively detect strabismus, anisometropia, or amblyopia. However, for detection of PVA 20/40 or worse in the subjects with abnormal binocularity, the total score of the survey yielded an area of 0.714 under the ROC curve (p = 0.010). The sensitivity was 88.2% and specificity was 61.9% with a cutoff at 0.50. CONCLUSION: The degree of 3D asthenopia and 3D perception while watching 3D TV were not effective for screening of abnormal binocularity. However, evaluation of the severity of 3D asthenopia and the quality of 3D perception can help screen of decrease in PVA that requires correction.","['Suh, Young-Woo', 'Kim, Seung-Hyun', 'Ha, Suk-Gyu', 'Seo, Hyejin', 'Ahn, Jaemoon']","['Suh YW', 'Kim SH', 'Ha SG', 'Seo H', 'Ahn J']","['a Department of Ophthalmology , Korea University College of Medicine , Seoul , Korea.', 'a Department of Ophthalmology , Korea University College of Medicine , Seoul , Korea.', 'a Department of Ophthalmology , Korea University College of Medicine , Seoul , Korea.', 'b Department of Ophthalmology , Gachon University Gil Medical Center , Incheon , Korea.', 'a Department of Ophthalmology , Korea University College of Medicine , Seoul , Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Eye Res,Current eye research,8104312,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Abnormal binocular vision', '*asthenopia', '*depth perception', '*three-dimensional image', '*vision screening']",,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/10/24 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02713683.2016.1158271 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Eye Res. 2017 Jan;42(1):155-160. doi: 10.3109/02713683.2016.1158271.

Two hundred and five X-ray security screeners participated in a questionnaire survey. The result showed that satisfaction with the VDT's physical features and the work environment conditions were negatively correlated with the intensity of visual fatigue, whereas job stress and job burnout had direct positive influences. The path coefficient between the image quality of VDT and visual fatigue was not significant. The total effects of job burnout, job stress, the VDT's physical features and the work environment conditions on visual fatigue were 0.471, 0.469, -0.268 and -0.251 respectively. These findings indicated that both extrinsic factors relating to VDT and workplace environment and psychological factors including job burnout and job stress should be considered in the workplace design and work organisation of security screening tasks to reduce screeners' visual fatigue.

The aim of conducting this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of accommodative anomalies (insufficiency, excess and infacility) in relation to demographic variables (sex, age, school grade level and study location). METHODS: Study participants comprised 1,211 children (481 male and 730 female), with age range 13-19 years. Visual functions evaluated included refractive error, accommodative amplitude, accuracy, facility and relative accommodation. RESULTS: A total of 242 participants (20.2%) had accommodative anomalies. Prevalence estimates were; accommodative infacility 12.9% (95% confidence interval, CI, 10.9-14.7%), accommodative insufficiency 4.5% (95% CI 3.4-5.8%) and accommodative excess 2.8% (95% CI 1.9-3.8%). There were no significant differences based on sex, school grade level or study site, except in the prevalence of accommodative infacility, which was significantly higher in the younger grade level than the older (P=0.027).

The prevalence estimates for accommodative insufficiency and excess found in the sample studied are relatively low, while that of accommodative infacility is high. Accommodative anomalies were not markedly associated with demographic variables except for the prevalence of accommodative infacility, which was significantly higher in the younger grade level than the older. Identification and referral are important steps towards diagnosis and treatment of accommodative anomalies. Future studies on differences in prevalence of accommodative anomalies among different racial populations will be relevant.","['Wajuihian, Samuel Otabor', 'Hansraj, Rekha']","['Wajuihian SO', 'Hansraj R']","['a Discipline of Optometry , School of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal , Durban , South Africa.', 'a Discipline of Optometry , School of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal , Durban , South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ophthalmic Epidemiol,Ophthalmic epidemiology,9435674,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Accommodative anomalies', '*South Africa', '*accommodative excess', '*accommodative infacility', '*accommodative insufficiency', '*school children']",,2016/06/03 06:00,2017/06/27 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09286586.2016.1155715 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Epidemiol. 2016 Oct;23(5):316-23. doi: 10.3109/09286586.2016.1155715.

However, it has been proposed that this model cannot explain responses to dynamic inputs such as found in intermittent rivalry and rivalry memory, where maintenance of a percept when the stimulus is absent is required. This challenges the universality of the basic canonical cortical circuit. Here, we show that by including an overlooked realistic small nonspecific background neural activity, the same basic model can reproduce intermittent rivalry and rivalry memory without compromising static rivalry and other cortical phenomena. The background activity induces a mutual-inhibition mechanism for short-term memory, which is robust to noise and where fine-tuning of recurrent excitation or inclusion of sub-threshold currents or synaptic facilitation is unnecessary. We prove existence conditions for the mechanism and show that it can explain experimental results from the quartet apparent motion illusion, which is a prototypical intermittent rivalry stimulus.","['Vattikuti, Shashaank', 'Thangaraj, Phyllis', 'Xie, Hua W', 'Gotts, Stephen J', 'Martin, Alex', 'Chow, Carson C']","['Vattikuti S', 'Thangaraj P', 'Xie HW', 'Gotts SJ', 'Martin A', 'Chow CC']","['Mathematical Biology Section, Laboratory of Biological Modeling, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Mathematical Biology Section, Laboratory of Biological Modeling, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Mathematical Biology Section, Laboratory of Biological Modeling, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Cognitive Neuropsychology Section, Laboratory of Brain and Cognition, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Cognitive Neuropsychology Section, Laboratory of Brain and Cognition, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Mathematical Biology Section, Laboratory of Biological Modeling, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,IM,,,,2016/05/04 06:00,2017/03/21 06:00,['2016/05/04 06:00'],"['2015/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004903 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-15-01402 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2016 May 3;12(5):e1004903. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004903. eCollection 2016 May.,,20160503,20170320,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/physiopathology', 'Computational Biology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term/*physiology', '*Models, Neurological', 'Nerve Net/physiology', 'Optical Illusions/physiology', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Visual Cortex/*physiology', 'Visual Perception/physiology']",PMC4854419,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3968-1563'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate how direct glare affects symptom development, muscle activity, and muscle blood flow in m. orbicularis oculi and m. trapezius during reading on a computer screen. METHODS: Fifteen healthy young adults with normal binocular vision read text on a computer screen at an optimized computer workplace, 30 minutes with glare exposure and 30 minutes with appropriate lighting. Postural angles were continuously registered. Development of eye symptoms and musculoskeletal pain in the neck and shoulder area were recorded using VAS scales. Muscle activity and muscle blood flow were measured continuously using electromyography and photoplethysmography, respectively. RESULTS: Glare exposure resulted in significantly more pronounced eye pain, increased orbicularis muscle activity, and increased trapezius blood flow compared to reading with appropriate lighting. There were no significant differences in posture between the two light conditions. There were also significant associations between orbicularis oculi activity and both trapezius blood flow and neck pain during both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the current study show that direct glare conditions cause increased eyestrain and orbicularis oculi contraction during reading on a computer screen. This study also indicates that exposure to direct glare affects the trapezius muscle, possibly by an interaction between the visual system, sympathetic nervous system, and head-stabilizing muscles. In addition, there were associations between the use of orbicularis oculi, trapezius blood flow, and development of neck pain independent of the lighting.","['Mork, Randi', 'Bruenech, Jan Richard', 'Thorud, Hanne Mari Schiotz']","['Mork R', 'Bruenech JR', 'Thorud HM']","['*PhD Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Faculty of Health Science (RM, JRB, HMST), University College of Southeast Norway, Kongsberg, Norway; and Department of Landscape Architecture & Spatial Planning (RM), Norwegian University of Life Sciences, As, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2016/03/24 06:00,2017/08/22 06:00,['2016/03/23 06:00'],"['2016/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0000000000000855 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2016 Jul;93(7):738-49. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0000000000000855.,,,20170821,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', '*Computers', 'Electromyography', 'Female', '*Glare', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/*physiopathology', 'Oculomotor Muscles/blood supply/*physiology', 'Photoplethysmography', '*Reading', 'Regional Blood Flow/physiology', 'Superficial Back Muscles/blood supply/*physiology', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 60 million people suffer from CVS globally, resulting in reduced productivity at work and reduced quality of life of the computer worker. The present study aims to describe the prevalence of CVS and its associated factors among a nationally-representative sample of Sri Lankan computer workers. METHODS: Two thousand five hundred computer office workers were invited for the study from all nine provinces of Sri Lanka between May and December 2009. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data, symptoms of CVS and its associated factors. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed in all patients with 'presence of CVS' as the dichotomous dependent variable and age, gender, duration of occupation, daily computer usage, pre-existing eye disease, not using a visual display terminal (VDT) filter, adjusting brightness of screen, use of contact lenses, angle of gaze and ergonomic practices knowledge as the continuous/dichotomous independent variables. A similar binary logistic regression analysis was performed in all patients with 'severity of CVS' as the dichotomous dependent variable and other continuous/dichotomous independent variables. RESULTS: Sample size was 2210 (response rate-88.4%). Mean age was 30.8 +/- 8.1 years and 50.8% of the sample were males. The 1-year prevalence of CVS in the study population was 67.4%. Female gender (OR: 1.28), duration of occupation (OR: 1.07), daily computer usage (1.10), pre-existing eye disease (OR: 4.49), not using a VDT filter (OR: 1.02), use of contact lenses (OR: 3.21) and ergonomics practices knowledge (OR: 1.24) all were associated with significantly presence of CVS. The duration of occupation (OR: 1.04) and presence of pre-existing eye disease (OR: 1.54) were significantly associated with the presence of 'severe CVS'. CONCLUSIONS: Sri Lankan computer workers had a high prevalence of CVS. Female gender, longer duration of occupation, higher daily computer usage, pre-existing eye disease, not using a VDT filter, use of contact lenses and higher ergonomics practices knowledge all were associated with significantly with the presence of CVS. The factors associated with the severity of CVS were the duration of occupation and presence of pre-existing eye disease.","['Ranasinghe, P', 'Wathurapatha, W S', 'Perera, Y S', 'Lamabadusuriya, D A', 'Kulatunga, S', 'Jayawardana, N', 'Katulanda, P']","['Ranasinghe P', 'Wathurapatha WS', 'Perera YS', 'Lamabadusuriya DA', 'Kulatunga S', 'Jayawardana N', 'Katulanda P']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka. priyanga.ranasinghe@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka. wsevwandi@hotmail.com.', 'Ministry of Health Care and Nutrition, Colombo, Sri Lanka. yashas2004@yahoo.com.', 'Ministry of Health Care and Nutrition, Colombo, Sri Lanka. dilu_lama@yahoo.com.', 'Ministry of Health Care and Nutrition, Colombo, Sri Lanka. supunkulatunga@yahoo.com.', 'Ministry of Health Care and Nutrition, Colombo, Sri Lanka. naveenjay@gmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka. prasad.katulanda@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,IM,,,,2016/03/10 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2016/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-016-1962-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13104-016-1962-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2016 Mar 9;9:150. doi: 10.1186/s13104-016-1962-1.,,20160309,20161107,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Ergonomics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Prevalence', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sri Lanka/epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*User-Computer Interface']",PMC4784392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A survey was conducted of 50 patients on the day before and 1 month after exotropia surgery. Survey results were analyzed by type of exotropia at presentation and age. Changes in subjective symptoms from preoperatively to postoperatively were examined for stereopsis (5 items), asthenopia (5 items), and appearance (5 items). Each item was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4. RESULTS: The mean age of the 50 patients was 10.6 +/- 7.75 years, and there were 21 (41.2%) males and 29 (56.9%) females. Thirty-two patients with intermittent exotropia had no significant improvement in the stereopsis or asthenopia symptoms. However, they showed significant (P < .05) improvement in the appearance symptoms of squint and out of focus. Eighteen patients with constant exotropia showed significant improvements in the symptoms of tripping over objects or running into a wall in stereopsis and of squint and out of focus in appearance (P < .05). Postoperatively, all patients had significant improvement in appearance-related symptoms regardless of age (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with constant exotropia had improved symptoms in stereopsis, asthenopia, and appearance after surgery. Appearance was improved regardless of the type of exotropia or age.","['Ha, Suk-Gyu', 'Kim, Seung-Hyun']","['Ha SG', 'Kim SH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus,Journal of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus,7901143,IM,,,,2016/02/03 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2016/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/01913913-20160113-05 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2016 Jan-Feb;53(1):44-51. doi: 10.3928/01913913-20160113-05.,"['Copyright 2016, SLACK Incorporated.']",,20161005,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Depth Perception/*physiology', 'Exotropia/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Postoperative Period', 'Preoperative Period', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with these advancements, there have also been reports on motion sickness and asthenopia induced by viewing stereoscopic films. Human equilibrium function deteriorates when viewing stereoscopic films, which may lead to motion sickness; however, the exact cause of such motion sickness remains unknown. Therefore, as part of hygiene research that contributes to society, it is important to consider the safety of viewing virtual 3D contents. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of viewing 2-D/3-D video clips on the human body by stabilometry, electrogastrography (EGG), and subjective assessments. Seven subjects aged 22 to 24 viewed 2-D/3-D video clips for 60 min. RESULTS: A comparison of time series data obtained at rest shows a significant change in the EGG patterns 20 min after the start of viewing the video clips. Furthermore, sway values while viewing the 3-D video clips were considerably higher than those while viewing the 2-D video clips 60 min after the start of viewing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the autonomic nervous system is affected first by long-term viewing of stereoscopic films, and the equilibrium function deteriorates gradually over the course of the exposure.","['Kinoshita, Fumiya', 'Mori, Yuki', 'Sugiura, Akihiro', 'Yamakawa, Tatsuya', 'Matsuura, Yasuyuki', 'Takada, Hiroki', 'Miyao, Masaru']","['Kinoshita F', 'Mori Y', 'Sugiura A', 'Yamakawa T', 'Matsuura Y', 'Takada H', 'Miyao M']","['Department of Information Engineering, Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Nihon Eiseigaku Zasshi,Nihon eiseigaku zasshi.

Sixty-eight healthy participants are divided into 2D and S3D groups and subjected to an oddball paradigm after being exposed to S3D videos with passive polarized display or 2D display. The age and fluid intelligence ability of the participants are controlled between the groups. ERP results do not show any significant differences between S3D and 2D groups to find the aftereffects of S3D in terms of visual and mental fatigues.

Proofreading speed and performance were equal for a TFT-LCD and a paper display, but there were more symptoms of eyestrain in the screen condition accompanied by a strong preference for paper (Experiment 1). These results were replicated using a longer reading duration (Experiment 2). Additional experiments were conducted to test hypotheses about the reasons for the higher amount of eyestrain associated with reading from screen. Reduced screen luminance did not change the pattern of results (Experiment 3), but positioning both displays in equal inclination angles eliminated the differences in eyestrain symptoms and increased proofreading speed in the screen condition (Experiment 4). A paper-like positioning of TFT-LCDs seems to enable unimpaired reading without evidence of increased physical strain. Practitioner Summary: Given the developments in screen technology, a re-assessment of the differences in proofreading speed and performance, well-being, and preference between computer screen and paper was conducted. State-of-the-art TFT-LCDs enable unimpaired reading, but a book-like positioning of screens seems necessary to minimise eyestrain symptoms.","['Kopper, Maja', 'Mayr, Susanne', 'Buchner, Axel']","['Kopper M', 'Mayr S', 'Buchner A']","['a Institut fur Experimentelle Psychologie , Heinrich-Heine-Universitat , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'b Lehrstuhl fur Psychologie mit Schwerpunkt Mensch-Maschine-Interaktion , Universitat Passau , Passau , Germany.', 'a Institut fur Experimentelle Psychologie , Heinrich-Heine-Universitat , Dusseldorf , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,['NOTNLM'],"['*TFT-LCD', '*display inclination', '*eyestrain', '*iPad', '*proofreading']",,2016/01/07 06:00,2017/05/04 06:00,['2016/01/07 06:00'],"['2016/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/00140139.2015.1100757 [doi]'],ppublish,Ergonomics. 2016 May;59(5):615-32. doi: 10.1080/00140139.2015.1100757.

It is unclear whether cycloplegic refraction is necessary in this age group. The purpose of this study was to compare the non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error measured in young adults. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 1400 eyes (n = 700) of enlisted soldiers aged 18 to 21 years who were consecutively evaluated in an outpatient army ophthalmology clinic. One drop of cyclopentolate 1 % was installed twice 10 min apart, and cycloplegic refraction was performed in both eyes 40 min later using an auto-refractor. The difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refractive measurements was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean difference in SE between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements was 0.68 +/- 0.83 D (95 % CI, 0.64-0.72). Significantly greater differences were observed in hypermetropes than myopes (1.30 +/- 0.90 D versus 0.46 +/- 0.68 D, p < 0.001). Moderate hypermetropes (2 to 5 D) demonstrated significantly greater refractive error than mild (0.5 to 2 D) or severe (>5 D) hypermetropes (1.71 +/- 1.18 D versus 1.19 +/- 0.74 D and 1.16 +/- 1.08 D respectively, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Young hypermetropic adults possessed +1 to +2 D of latent hypermetropia. In contrast, young myopic adults revealed pseudomyopia of -0.5 D. Cycloplegic refraction should be performed in young hypermetropic adults complaining of various signs of asthenopia.","['Mimouni, Michael', 'Zoller, Lilach', 'Horowitz, Josefa', 'Wygnanski-Jaffe, Tamara', 'Morad, Yair', 'Mezer, Eedy']","['Mimouni M', 'Zoller L', 'Horowitz J', 'Wygnanski-Jaffe T', 'Morad Y', 'Mezer E']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Rambam Health Care Campus, P.O.B. 9602, Haifa, Israel, 31096. m_mimouni@rambam.health.gov.il.', 'Maccabi Health Service, Haifa, Israel.', 'Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Assaf-Harofeh Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Rambam Health Care Campus, P.O.B. 9602, Haifa, Israel, 31096.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,8205248,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Adults', 'Cycloplegic', 'Refraction', 'Young']",,2015/12/22 06:00,2016/09/24 06:00,['2015/12/22 06:00'],"['2015/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00417-015-3246-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00417-015-3246-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2016 Feb;254(2):395-8. doi: 10.1007/s00417-015-3246-1.

Hermann Cohn and the Emergence of the Fin de Siecle Hygiene of Reading].",305-20,10.1002/bewi.201501731 [doi],"From the 1860s onward, 'eye experts' increasingly fretted the alleged surge of myopia attributed to an increase of reading matter circulating in schools. In order to avert the inauspicious prospects, revised school desks designed to prevent children from becoming myopic were introduced. During the 1880s, said experts turned to printed matter, maintaining that books must become more reader friendly. Along with the turn to books, a peculiar shift within the hygiene discourse occurred: While the ill addressed by school desk-revisions was myopia, the goal of revising book design was to make reading less tiring. This paper explores both the shift from the hygiene of the eye to the hygiene of reading as well as the materialization of the stipulations and claims made by reading hygienists. In doing so, the paper demonstrates that optimizing the reading process was closely linked to a fear of overburdening and fatigue which expressed itself in the psychopathological discourse of the time.","['Grutter, Fabian']",['Grutter F'],"['(MA ETH), ETH Zurich, Clausiusstrasse 59, CH-8092 Zurich. fabian.gruetter@wiss.gess.ethz.ch.']",['ger'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ber Wiss,Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte,7909914,QIS,['NOTNLM'],"['Augenhygiene', 'Fin de Siecle', 'Kurzsichtigkeit', 'Lesehygiene', 'Ophthalmologie', 'Schulbank', 'Typographie', 'fin de siecle', 'hygiene of the eye', 'myopia', 'ophthalmology', 'overburdening', 'reading hygiene', 'school desk', 'typography', 'Uberburdung']",,2015/12/08 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/12/08 06:00'],"['2015/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bewi.201501731 [doi]'],ppublish,Ber Wiss. 2015 Dec;38(4):305-20. doi: 10.1002/bewi.201501731.,,,20161213,,,"['Asthenopia/complications/*history/prevention & control', 'Books/*history', 'Child', '*Eye', 'History, 19th Century', 'Humans', '*Hygiene', 'Myopia/etiology/*history/prevention & control', '*Reading', '*Refraction, Ocular', 'Schools/history']",,,,"Brennpunkt ""reading animal"".

A total of 20 ME/CFS patients and 20 matched (age, gender) controls were recruited to the study. Pattern-related visual stress was determined using the Pattern Glare Test. Participants viewed three patterns, the spatial frequencies (SF) of which were 0.3 (low-SF), 2.3 (mid-SF), and 9.4 (high-SF) cycles per degree (c/deg). They reported the number of distortions they experienced when viewing each pattern. ME/CFS patients exhibited significantly higher pattern glare scores than controls for the mid-SF pattern. Mid-high SF differences were also significantly higher in patients than controls. These findings provide evidence of altered visual perception in ME/CFS. Pattern-related visual stress may represent an identifiable clinical feature of ME/CFS that will prove useful in its diagnosis. However, further research is required to establish if these symptoms reflect ME/CFS-related changes in the functioning of sensory neural pathways.","['Wilson, Rachel L', 'Paterson, Kevin B', 'Hutchinson, Claire V']","['Wilson RL', 'Paterson KB', 'Hutchinson CV']","['College of Medicine, Biological Sciences and Psychology, University of Leicester, UK.', 'College of Medicine, Biological Sciences and Psychology, University of Leicester, UK.', 'College of Medicine, Biological Sciences and Psychology, University of Leicester, UK. ch190@le.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Perception,Perception,0372307,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'pattern-related visual stress']",,2015/11/13 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['0301006615614467 [pii]', '10.1177/0301006615614467 [doi]']",ppublish,Perception. 2015 Dec;44(12):1422-6. doi: 10.1177/0301006615614467.

OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the current knowledge about the symptoms, related factors and treatment modalities for CVS. METHODS: Relevant literature on CVS published during the past 65 years was analyzed. RESULTS: Symptoms reported by computer users are classified into internal ocular symptoms (strain and ache), external ocular symptoms (dryness, irritation, burning), visual symptoms (blur, double vision) and musculoskeletal symptoms (neck and shoulder pain). The major factors associated with CVS are either environmental (improper lighting, display position and viewing distance) and/or dependent on the user's visual abilities (uncorrected refractive error, oculomotor disorders and tear film abnormalities). CONCLUSION: Although the factors associated with CVS have been identified the physiological mechanisms that underlie CVS are not completely understood. Additionally, advances in technology have led to the increased use of hand-held devices, which might impose somewhat different visual challenges compared to desktop displays. Further research is required to better understand the physiological mechanisms underlying CVS and symptoms associated with the use of hand-held and stereoscopic displays.","['Gowrisankaran, Sowjanya', 'Sheedy, James E']","['Gowrisankaran S', 'Sheedy JE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'visual stress', 'visual-ergonomics']",,2015/11/01 06:00,2016/12/17 06:00,['2015/11/01 06:00'],"['2015/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['WOR2162 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-152162 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2015;52(2):303-14. doi: 10.3233/WOR-152162.,,,20161216,,,"['*Computer Terminals', 'Computers, Handheld', 'Ergonomics', 'Eye Diseases/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Lighting/adverse effects', 'Neck Pain/*etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Posture', 'Risk Factors', 'Shoulder Pain/*etiology', 'Syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The medical records of participants aged 5 to <18 years who were diagnosed with symptomatic CI and were treated with the Computerized Vergence System (CVS) program were retrospectively reviewed. All participants were prescribed 9 or 15 minutes of daily convergence exercises with the CVS program, 5 days per week, for the initial 6 weeks. Near point of convergence (NPC) and near convergence amplitude (NCA) were measured at baseline, 6 week, and final examinations. The presence or absence of diplopia and asthenopia with reading were recorded at baseline and final examinations. RESULTS: A total of 186 participants were included. At diagnosis, 72 participants (39%) reported diplopia and 182 (98%), reported asthenopia. At final examination, 172 participants (92%) were asymptomatic. Twelve participants (6%) subsequently received other treatment modalities. Mean NPC at baseline (5.9 cm) improved after 6 weeks of CVS therapy (3.3 cm) and at final examination (2.9 cm; P < 0.0005).

Clinical visual fatigue characteristics caused by 2-D and 3-D animations may be different, but have not been characterized in detail. This study tried to distinguish the differential effects on visual fatigue caused by 2-D and 3-D animations. A total of 23 volunteers were subjected to accommodation and vergence assessments, followed by a 40-min video game program designed to aggravate their asthenopic symptoms. The volunteers were then assessed for accommodation and vergence parameters again and directed to watch a 5-min 3-D video program, and then assessed again for the parameters. The results support that the 3-D animations caused similar characteristics in vision fatigue parameters in some specific aspects as compared to that caused by 2-D animations. Furthermore, 3-D animations may lead to more exhaustion in both ciliary and extra-ocular muscles, and such differential effects were more evident in the high demand of near vision work. The current results indicated that an arbitrary set of indexes may be promoted in the design of 3-D display or equipments.","['Chang, Yu-Shuo', 'Hsueh, Ya-Hsin', 'Tung, Kwong-Chung', 'Jhou, Fong-Yi', 'Lin, David Pei-Cheng']","['Chang YS', 'Hsueh YH', 'Tung KC', 'Jhou FY', 'Lin DP']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Optometry, Jen-Teh Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, MiaoLi, Taiwan.', 'Department of Electornic Engineering, National Yunlin University, Yunlin, Taiwan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Electornic Engineering, National Yunlin University, Yunlin, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Technol Health Care,Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,9314590,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['3-D animation', 'accommodation-vergence linkage', 'fatigue parameters', 'visual fatigue']",,2015/10/08 06:00,2016/09/28 06:00,['2015/10/08 06:00'],"['2015/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['THC--1-THC1079 [pii]', '10.3233/THC-151079 [doi]']",ppublish,Technol Health Care. 2015;24 Suppl 1:S231-5. doi: 10.3233/THC-151079.,,,20160927,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Male', '*Video Games', 'Vision Tests']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of all children attending the first to eighth grades at two public schools in the urban region of a medium-sized town in Southern Brazil between April and December 2012. A questionnaire on socioeconomic and cultural matters was answered by parents, while the children answered a questionnaire on asthenopia-related symptoms. The children underwent a complete visual function examination, including measurement of visual acuity, refraction test, cover test, stereopsis, heterophoria assessment, near point of convergence, and accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio. RESULTS: Asthenopia prevalence was 24.7% in a total sample of 964 children. Visual acuity of 20/25 or better in both eyes was found in 92.8% of the children. The stereopsis test was normal in 99.4% of them, and some kind of strabismus was found in 3.5%. About 37.8% had astigmatism, 71.6% had mild hyperopia, 13.6% had moderate hyperopia, and 6.1% were myopic. Near point of convergence was abnormal in 14.0% of the children, and the accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio was found to be altered in 17.1% of them. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents have expressive prevalence of asthenopia. The prevalence of visual function alterations does not differ from the general population, and, therefore, they are not prerequisites. It is very important that its mechanisms and risk factors be better defined. Health professionals need to be on the lookout for complaints of visual fatigue because of its potential to influence learning and school performance.","['Vilela, Manuel Ap', 'Castagno, Victor D', 'Meucci, Rodrigo D', 'Fassa, Anaclaudia G']","['Vilela MA', 'Castagno VD', 'Meucci RD', 'Fassa AG']","['Postdoctoral Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil ; Department of Specialized Medicine - Ophthalmology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Specialized Medicine - Ophthalmology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil ; Doctoral Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Doctoral Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil ; Department of Social Medicine, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Doctoral Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil ; Department of Social Medicine, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Clin Ophthalmol,"Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)",101321512,,['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'eye fatigue', 'eyestrain', 'fatigue', 'visual', 'visual fatigue']",,2015/09/12 06:00,2015/09/12 06:01,['2015/09/11 06:00'],"['2015/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OPTH.S84976 [doi]', 'opth-9-1595 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Ophthalmol. 2015 Aug 28;9:1595-603. doi: 10.2147/OPTH.S84976. eCollection 2015.,,20150828,20150911,,,,PMC4559242,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several researchers have hypothesized an underlying or causal influence that may account for this relationship. The magnocellular theory of dyslexia proposes that a deficit in visuo-temporal processing can explain symptomology for both disorders. If the magnocellular theory holds true, individuals who experience symptomology for these disorders should show impairment on a visuo-temporal task, such as driving. Eighteen male participants formed the sample for this study. Self-report measures assessed dyslexia and visual stress symptomology as well as participant IQ. Participants completed a drive simulation in which errors in response to road signs were measured. Bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between scores on measures of dyslexia and visual stress. Results also demonstrated that self-reported symptomology predicts magnocellular impairment as measured by performance on a driving task. Results from this study suggest that a magnocellular deficit offers a likely explanation for individuals who report high symptomology across both conditions. While conclusions about the impact of these disorders on driving performance should not be derived from this research alone, this study provides a platform for the development of future research, utilizing a clinical population and on-road driving assessment techniques.","['Fisher, Carri', 'Chekaluk, Eugene', 'Irwin, Julia']","['Fisher C', 'Chekaluk E', 'Irwin J']","['Macquarie University, New South Wales, 2109, Australia.', 'Macquarie University, New South Wales, 2109, Australia.', 'Macquarie University, New South Wales, 2109, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Dyslexia,"Dyslexia (Chichester, England)",9511375,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['driving', 'dyslexia', 'magnocellular theory', 'vision', 'visual stress']",,2015/09/04 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2015/09/04 06:00'],"['2014/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dys.1504 [doi]'],ppublish,Dyslexia. 2015 Nov;21(4):350-60. doi: 10.1002/dys.1504.

We asked whether the vergence position of rest is correlated with discomfort on reading. METHODS: We examined 20 subjects who reported strain on prolonged reading (""asthenopes"") and 20 subjects who did not (""non-asthenopes""). The eyes were normal in all subjects. Associated phoria (AP) was determined by asking the subjects to align monocular markers in the Mallett Near Vision Unit. In addition, subjects were asked to adjust Risley prisms so that viewing appeared most relaxing while they were looking at fully fusionable pictures (self-selected prism=SSP). Both AP and SSP were determined at near. Each subject participated in 6 sessions. Before each session, the subjects read a text for 30 minutes. Immediately afterwards they indicated on a visual analogue scale the discomfort they had experienced during the 30 minutes. RESULTS: In asthenopic individuals, AP fluctuated up to 19Delta, SSP up to 20Delta. In non-asthenopic individuals, AP fluctuated up to 17Delta, SSP up to 20Delta. The correlation between AP and SSP was r=0.73 (p<0.001) in the non-asthenopes and r=0.81 (p<0.001) in the asthenopes. Neither AP nor SSP were significantly larger in the asthenopes than in the non-asthenopes. Intra-individually, among the 6 sessions, the magnitude of discomfort was not significantly correlated to AP or SSP, neither in the asthenopes nor in the non-asthenopes. Asthenopes who rated their discomfort higher did not have a larger heterophoria. CONCLUSION: The lack of a significant correlation between discomfort and (horizontal) heterophoria (determined as AP or SSP), especially intra-individually among repeated measurements, does not support a causal relationship.","['Kommerell, Guntram', 'Kromeier, Miriam', 'Scharff, Felix', 'Bach, Michael']","['Kommerell G', 'Kromeier M', 'Scharff F', 'Bach M']","['University Eye Center , Freiburg , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Strabismus,Strabismus,9310896,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Aligning prism', 'associated phoria', 'asthenopia', 'circadian rhythm', 'heterophoria', 'self-selected prism', 'vergence position of rest']",,2015/07/15 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/07/10 06:00'],"['2015/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09273972.2015.1036080 [doi]'],ppublish,Strabismus. 2015;23(2):51-65. doi: 10.3109/09273972.2015.1036080.,,,20161213,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reading', 'Research Design', 'Strabismus/*physiopathology', 'Vision Disparity/physiology', 'Vision Tests', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: This study is a prospective clinical study. METHODS: Thirty-three participants (17 men and 16 women; age range, 28-39 years) were divided into 3 groups. Each group wore 1 of 3 types of lenses while performing an intensive computer task for 2 hours. To evaluate the effect of blocking short-wavelength light before and after the task, we measured the CFF and evaluated subjective questionnaires. We used the analysis of variance test to examine whether the type of lenses tested affected any of the visual fatigue-related parameters. RESULTS: The type of lens worn significantly affected the CFF; however, answers to the subjective questionnaires did not differ significantly between the groups. Two of the 13 question items showed a statistical difference between lens transparency and increase in the CFF (lens 3 > lens 2 > lens 1). CONCLUSIONS: The higher the blocking effect of the lens, the lower the reduction in the CFF, suggesting that blocking short-wavelength light can reduce eye fatigue.","['Ide, Takeshi', 'Toda, Ikuko', 'Miki, Emiko', 'Tsubota, Kazuo']","['Ide T', 'Toda I', 'Miki E', 'Tsubota K']","['From the *Minamiaoyama Eye Clinic; and daggerDepartment of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Study', 'Journal Article']",China,Asia Pac J Ophthalmol (Phila),"Asia-Pacific journal of ophthalmology (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101583622,IM,,,,2015/06/13 06:00,2016/03/17 06:00,['2015/06/13 06:00'],"['2015/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/APO.0000000000000069 [doi]', '01599573-201503000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Asia Pac J Ophthalmol (Phila). 2015 Mar-Apr;4(2):80-5. doi: 10.1097/APO.0000000000000069.,,,20160316,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Computer Terminals', 'Eye Pain/etiology/*prevention & control', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Flicker Fusion/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Light/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a randomized, crossover, open-label clinical trial where subjective responses, with and without contact lenses, were assessed every 2 hours during five stages (A to E). Each stage began at the time when subjects would normally have inserted their contact lenses (T0). During stage A, no lenses were worn, whereas in stage B, lenses were worn continuously for 12 hours. In stages C to E, lenses were worn for only 4 hours. Contact lenses were inserted at T0 for stage C, but for stages D and E, lenses were not inserted until T0 + 4 and T0 + 8 hours, respectively. Mixed linear models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In the absence of contact lenses, ocular comfort and dryness remained reasonably constant throughout the observation period. Ocular comfort and dryness decreased during 12 hours of continuous lens wear and became significantly worse from the 8-hour time onward compared with insertion (p < 0.023). There were no significant differences in terms of ocular comfort and dryness between any of the 4-hour lens wear stages (p < 0.82). During each 4-hour stage, both comfort and dryness behaved in a similar fashion (p > 0.05) to the first 4 hours of continuous contact lens wear. Comparing the scores of each of these stages with the no-lens response at the corresponding time showed no significant differences for comfort (p > 0.23) or dryness (p > 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Short periods of wear can be experienced at any time of day without significant change in ocular discomfort and dryness. This suggests that subjective responses at the end of the day are determined by the length of time lenses are in contact with the eye, rather than the time of day at which lenses are worn.","['Papas, Eric', 'Tilia, Daniel', 'McNally, John', 'de la Jara, Percy Lazon']","['Papas E', 'Tilia D', 'McNally J', 'de la Jara PL']","['*PhD, FAAO daggerMOptom, FAAO double daggerOD, FAAO section signPhD Brien Holden Vision Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia (EP, DT, PLdlJ); Vision Cooperative Research Centre, Sydney, Australia (EP, PLdlJ); School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia (EP, PLdlJ); and CIBA Vision, Duluth, Georgia (JMc).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2015/05/24 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/05/24 06:00'],"['2015/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/OPX.0000000000000607 [doi]', '00006324-201506000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2015 Jun;92(6):665-70. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0000000000000607.,,,20150825,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Contact Lenses/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOURCES: Inclusion criteria were population-based studies from 1960 to May of 2014 reporting the prevalence of asthenopia in children. The search was performed independently by two reviewers in the PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS databases, with no language restriction. This systematic review was performed in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA Statement. Downs and Black score was used for quality assessment. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Out of 1692 potentially relevant citations retrieved from electronic databases and searches of reference lists, 26 were identified as potentially eligible. Five of these studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 2465 subjects. Pooled prevalence of asthenopia was 19.7% (12.4-26.4%). The majority of children with asthenopia did not present visual acuity or refraction abnormalities. The largest study evaluated 1448 children aged 6 years and estimated a prevalence of 12.6%. Associated risk factors were not clearly established. CONCLUSION: Although asthenopia is a frequent and relevant clinical problem in childhood, with potential consequences for learning, the scarcity of studies about the prevalence and clinical impact of asthenopia hinders the effective planning of public health measures.","['Vilela, Manuel A P', 'Pellanda, Lucia C', 'Fassa, Anaclaudia G', 'Castagno, Victor D']","['Vilela MA', 'Pellanda LC', 'Fassa AG', 'Castagno VD']","['Universidade Federal de Pelotas (UFPel), Pelotas, RS, Brazil.

Various modalities such as electroencephalograms (EEGs), biomedical signals, and eye responses have been investigated. However, the majority of the previous research has analyzed each modality separately to measure user eye fatigue. This cannot guarantee the credibility of the resulting eye fatigue evaluations. Therefore, we propose a new method for quantitatively evaluating eye fatigue related to 3D content by combining multimodal measurements. This research is novel for the following four reasons: first, for the evaluation of eye fatigue with high credibility on 3D displays, a fuzzy-based fusion method (FBFM) is proposed based on the multimodalities of EEG signals, eye blinking rate (BR), facial temperature (FT), and subjective evaluation (SE); second, to measure a more accurate variation of eye fatigue (before and after watching a 3D display), we obtain the quality scores of EEG signals, eye BR, FT and SE; third, for combining the values of the four modalities we obtain the optimal weights of the EEG signals BR, FT and SE using a fuzzy system based on quality scores; fourth, the quantitative level of the variation of eye fatigue is finally obtained using the weighted sum of the values measured by the four modalities. Experimental results confirm that the effectiveness of the proposed FBFM is greater than other conventional multimodal measurements. Moreover, the credibility of the variations of the eye fatigue using the FBFM before and after watching the 3D display is proven using a t-test and descriptive statistical analysis using effect size.","['Bang, Jae Won', 'Choi, Jong-Suk', 'Heo, Hwan', 'Park, Kang Ryoung']","['Bang JW', 'Choi JS', 'Heo H', 'Park KR']","['Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. bangjw@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. jjongssuk@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. gjghks@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. parkgr@dongguk.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",101204366,IM,,,,2015/05/12 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s150510825 [pii]', '10.3390/s150510825 [doi]']",epublish,Sensors (Basel). 2015 May 7;15(5):10825-51. doi: 10.3390/s150510825.,,20150507,20151130,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Blinking/physiology', 'Body Temperature/physiology', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography/*classification', 'Equipment Design', 'Face/physiology', 'Female', '*Fuzzy Logic', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Male', 'Scalp/physiology', '*Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Young Adult']",PMC4481891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed from August 2012 to February 2013 in the Medical Corporation Jico-kai Yagi Hospital, and the Shinyokohama Shinoharaguchi Orthopedic Surgery and Dermatology Clinic, in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-one office workers aged 20-40 years that used VDTs were screened by critical flicker fusion (CFF) and near point accommodation (NPA). INTERVENTION: The participants were randomized to either a BE (480 mg/day) or placebo (vehicle) group, and took allocated capsule, daily, for 8 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The CFF, NPA, contrast visual acuity, functional visual acuity, keratoconjunctival epithelial damage, and fluorescein tear film break-up time were examined, and 18 subjective symptoms of eye fatigue were evaluated by questionnaire. Adverse events were reported via medical interviews. Data were collected both before and after VDT load at baseline, and 4, and 8 weeks after daily supplementation with either BE or placebo. RESULTS: Of 281 participants screened, 88 having relatively lower levels of CFF and NPA were enrolled in the study. Of these, 37 control and 43 BE group subjects completed the study. The VDT load-induced reduction in CFF was alleviated after 8 weeks of BE supplementation (95% confidence interval, 0.10-1.60; p=0.023), in contrast to placebo supplementation, while NPA variation was not. Of the subjective symptoms of eye fatigue, VDT load-induced ocular fatigue sensation, ocular pain, eye heaviness, uncomfortable sensation, and foreign body sensation were mitigated more in the BE group than in the control group, at week 8 (p<0.05). There were no severe adverse events in either group. CONCLUSIONS: BE supplementation improved some of the objective and subjective parameters of eye fatigue induced by VDT loads.","['Ozawa, Y', 'Kawashima, M', 'Inoue, S', 'Inagaki, E', 'Suzuki, A', 'Ooe, E', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Tsubota, K']","['Ozawa Y', 'Kawashima M', 'Inoue S', 'Inagaki E', 'Suzuki A', 'Ooe E', 'Kobayashi S', 'Tsubota K']","['Kazuo Tsubota M.D., Ph.D. Professor and Chairman, Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine; 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.

Designs utilising prism or peripheral ballast may result in residual prism in the optic zone. This study quantifies the vertical prism in the central 6mm present in TSCLs with various stabilisation methods. METHOD: Vertical prism was computed using published refractive index and vertical thickness changes in the central optic zone on a full lens thickness map. Thickness maps were measured using scanning transmission microscopy. Designs tested were reusable, silicone hydrogel and hydrogel TSCLs: SofLens((R)) Toric, PureVision((R))2 for Astigmatism, PureVision((R)) Toric, Biofinity((R)) Toric, Avaira((R)) Toric, clariti((R)) toric, AIR OPTIX((R)) for ASTIGMATISM and ACUVUE OASYS((R)) for ASTIGMATISM; with eight parameter combinations for each lens (-6.00DS to +3.00DS, -1.25DC, 90 degrees and 180 degrees axes). RESULTS: All TSCL designs evaluated had vertical prism in the optic zone except one which had virtually none (0.01Delta). Mean prism ranged from 0.52Delta to 1.15Delta, with three designs having prism that varied with sphere power. Vertical prism in ACUVUE OASYS((R)) for ASTIGMATISM was significantly lower than all other TSCLs tested. CONCLUSIONS: TSCL designs utilising prism-ballast and peri-ballast for stabilisation have vertical prism in the central optic zone. In monocular astigmats fitted with a TSCL or those wearing a mix of toric designs, vertical prism imbalance could create or exacerbate disturbances in binocular vision function. Practitioners should be aware of this potential effect when selecting which TSCL designs to prescribe, particularly for monocular astigmats with pre-existing binocular vision anomalies, and when managing complaints of asthenopia in monocular astigmats.","['Sulley, Anna', 'Hawke, Ryan', 'Lorenz, Kathrine Osborn', 'Toubouti, Youssef', 'Olivares, Giovanna']","['Sulley A', 'Hawke R', 'Lorenz KO', 'Toubouti Y', 'Olivares G']","['Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Wokingham, UK.

We report two cases in which the long-term use of mucin-inducing eye drops improved chronic ocular graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD)-related dry eye and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP)-like disease. CASE REPORTS: Case 1. A 61-year-old woman had cGVHD-related dry eye that resisted traditional medications. Next, we use topical diquafosol in addition to conventional treatments. The patient used diquafosol for 6 months without experiencing any side effects. The symptoms, including dry-eye sensation, ocular pain, foreign body sensation, and photophobia, as well as ocular surface findings including fluorescein and rose bengal scores and tear break-up time (TBUT), partly improved. To further improve the clinical signs and symptoms and decrease chronic inflammation, rebamipide was added to diquafosol. The symptoms, TBUT, and fluorescein and rose bengal scores markedly improved after long-term dual treatment without any side effects for 6 months. Case 2. A 77-year-old woman had OCP-like disease with dry eye. The patient did not improve using the currently available conventional treatments. Next, we use topical rebamipide in addition to conventional treatments. Symptoms including asthenopia, dry-eye sensation, ocular pain, and dull sensation, as well as fluorescein and rose bengal scores and TBUT, partly improved. Specifically, functional visual acuity was markedly improved after commencement of rebamipide. To further improve the clinical signs and symptoms and increase tear film stability and tear film volume, diquafosol was added to rebamipide. The combination of diquafosol and rebamipide worked for the patient. Improvements were seen in several symptoms, fluorescein and rose bengal scores, Schirmer test value, and TBUT without any side effects for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with topical rebamipide and diquafosol can improve dry eye in patients with cGVHD or OCP-like disease.","['Yamane, Mio', 'Ogawa, Yoko', 'Fukui, Masaki', 'Kamoi, Mizuka', 'Saijo-Ban, Yumiko', 'Yaguchi, Saori', 'Mukai, Shin', 'Kawakita, Tetsuya', 'Simmura, Shigeto', 'Tsubota, Kazuo']","['Yamane M', 'Ogawa Y', 'Fukui M', 'Kamoi M', 'Saijo-Ban Y', 'Yaguchi S', 'Mukai S', 'Kawakita T', 'Simmura S', 'Tsubota K']","['*MD daggerPhD Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan (all authors).']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2015/03/19 06:00,2015/06/20 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0000000000000523 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2015 Apr;92(4 Suppl 1):S25-32. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0000000000000523.,,,20150619,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)', '0 (Polyphosphates)', '0 (Purinergic P2Y Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Uracil Nucleotides)', '7828VC80FJ (diquafosol)', 'LR583V32ZR (rebamipide)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'TPY09G7XIR (Fluorescein)']",,"['Administration, Topical', 'Aged', 'Alanine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluorescein', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Ophthalmic Solutions', 'Pemphigoid, Benign Mucous Membrane/*complications/drug therapy', 'Polyphosphates/*therapeutic use', 'Purinergic P2Y Receptor Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Quinolones/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uracil Nucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Visual Acuity']",PMC4376271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Our computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) was based on a literature review and validated through discussion with experts and performance of a pretest, pilot test, and retest. Content validity was evaluated by occupational health, optometry, and ophthalmology experts. Rasch analysis was used in the psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire. Criterion validity was determined by calculating the sensitivity and specificity, receiver operator characteristic curve, and cutoff point. Test-retest repeatability was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance by Cohen's kappa (kappa). RESULTS: The CVS-Q was developed with wide consensus among experts and was well accepted by the target group. It assesses the frequency and intensity of 16 symptoms using a single rating scale (symptom severity) that fits the Rasch rating scale model well. The questionnaire has sensitivity and specificity over 70% and achieved good test-retest repeatability both for the scores obtained [ICC = 0.802; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.673, 0.884] and CVS classification (kappa = 0.612; 95% CI: 0.384, 0.839). CONCLUSION: The CVS-Q has acceptable psychometric properties, making it a valid and reliable tool to control the visual health of computer workers, and can potentially be used in clinical trials and outcome research.","['Segui, Maria del Mar', 'Cabrero-Garcia, Julio', 'Crespo, Ana', 'Verdu, Jose', 'Ronda, Elena']","['Segui Mdel M', 'Cabrero-Garcia J', 'Crespo A', 'Verdu J', 'Ronda E']","['Optic Pharmacology and Anatomy Department, Public Health Research Group, University of Alicante, Carretera de San Vicente del Raspeig s/n. 03690, San Vicente del Raspeig, Alicante, Spain.

Five hundred and ninety-nine of them viewed different S3D movies, and 255 subjects viewed a 2D version of a film seen in S3D by 251 subjects from the S3D group for a between-subjects design for that comparison. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factors underlying symptoms: External Symptoms Factors (ESF) with a mean +/- S.D. symptom score of 1.51 +/- 0.58 comprised of eye burning, eye ache, eye strain, eye irritation and tearing; and Internal Symptoms Factors (ISF) with a mean +/- S.D. symptom score of 1.38 +/- 0.51 comprised of blur, double vision, headache, dizziness and nausea. ISF and ESF were significantly correlated (Spearman r = 0.55; p = 0.001) but with external symptoms significantly higher than internal ones (Wilcoxon Signed-ranks test; p = 0.001). The age of participants did not significantly affect symptoms. However, females had higher scores than males for both ESF and ISF, and myopes had higher ISF scores than hyperopes. Newly released movies provided lower ESF scores than older movies, while the seat position of spectators had minimal effect. Symptoms while viewing S3D movies were significantly and negatively correlated to the duration of wearing S3D glasses. Kruskal-Wallis results showed that symptoms were significantly greater for S3D compared to those of 2D movies, both for ISF (p = 0.001) and for ESF (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In short, the analysis of the symptoms experienced by S3D movie spectators based on retrospective visual comfort assessments, showed a higher level of external symptoms (eye burning, eye ache, tearing, etc.) when compared to the internal ones that are typically more perceptual (blurred vision, double vision, headache, etc.). Furthermore, spectators of S3D movies reported statistically higher symptoms when compared to 2D spectators.","['Zeri, Fabrizio', 'Livi, Stefano']","['Zeri F', 'Livi S']","['Optics and Optometry, Department of Sciences, Roma Tre University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['2D movie', 'stereoscopic three-dimensional movie', 'visual discomfort', 'visual symptoms']",,2015/02/17 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/opo.12194 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2015 May;35(3):271-82. doi: 10.1111/opo.12194.

We measured and compared visual discomfort and visual fatigue induced by three-dimensional (3D) surgical imaging system and two-dimentional (2D) surgical imaging system, respectively. METHODS: This study compared ocular symptoms and visual functions immediately after four laparoscopic tasks including pick beans, paper cut, pass the curved needle, and knot tying. Ten participants started with 3D laparoscopy, 9 participants with 2D laparoscopy on the first day, and reversed the laparoscopy for the participants on the second day. Before performing the tasks and immediately after performing the tasks for 1 hour, the participants underwent an interview with questions on ocular symptoms, and then received the systematic measurements of the visual functions objectively. The ocular symptoms were compared between the two groups, and the visual functions were compared in each group and between the two groups. RESULTS: When comparing the 3D laparoscopy group with the 2D laparoscopy group, symptom scores showed statistically significant differences in blurred vision during the task (z=-3.64, P=0.00), irritated or burning eyes (z=-2.17, P=0.03), dry eyes (z=-2.72, P=0.01), eyestrain (z=-3.11, P=0.00), headache (z=-3.20, P=0.00), discomfort in eyes (z=-3.74, P=0.00). The objective visual functional parameters such as distance exophoria (P=0.83), near exophoria (P=0.88), distance esophoria (P=0.93), near esophoria (P=0.80), the fusion range (P=0.09), the accommodative convergence/accommodation (P=0.56), and the tear film breakup time (P=0.48) had no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: When the passively polarized 3D surgical imaging system was compared with the 2D surgical imaging system, although subjective feelings were uncomfortable, there was no objective evidence to indicate that the 3D surgical imaging system resulted in an increment of visual fatigue. The visual fatigue and discomforts were moderate and could be tolerated by the surgeons.","['Zhou, Jun', 'Xu, Han-jiang', 'Liang, Chao-zhao', 'Zhang, Li', 'Hao, Zong-yao', 'Feng, Li-xia']","['Zhou J', 'Xu HJ', 'Liang CZ', 'Zhang L', 'Hao ZY', 'Feng LX']","['1 Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Institute of Urology, Anhui Medical University , Hefei, China .', '1 Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Institute of Urology, Anhui Medical University , Hefei, China .', '1 Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Institute of Urology, Anhui Medical University , Hefei, China .', '1 Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Institute of Urology, Anhui Medical University , Hefei, China .', '1 Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Institute of Urology, Anhui Medical University , Hefei, China .', '2 Department of Ophthalmology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Institute of Urology, Anhui Medical University , Hefei, China .']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Endourol,Journal of endourology,8807503,IM,,,,2015/02/12 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/02/12 06:00'],"['2015/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/end.2014.0759 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endourol. 2015 Jul;29(7):816-20. doi: 10.1089/end.2014.0759.

The data of fMRI during three kinds of visual stimulation tasks were obtained from twenty subjects. At first, blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal changes during stimuli of checkerboard task were compared before and after one-hour watching 3D/2DTV, and subjective evaluation was conducted based on the questionnaire simultaneously. Then 3D and 2D images were used to stimulate healthy individuals to measure brain activities that correlated with stereoscopic vision. Finally, the relationship between front or back depth of field images and visual fatigue was investigated. The results reveal that the 3D group shows more significant differences of brain activities in BA8, BA17, BA18 and BA19 than the 2D group during the checkerboard stimulation. BA5, BA6, BA7 and BA8 were testified to have close relationship with stereoscopic perception via the 2D/3D images stimulation. Furthermore, the front depth of field image was proven to impose a more serious impact on visual fatigue than the back one. These conclusions are useful for healthy and reasonable 3DTV watching as well as properly designing of 3D scenes.","['Chen, Chunxiao', 'Wang, Jing', 'Li, Kun', 'Liu, Yuping', 'Chen, Xin']","['Chen C', 'Wang J', 'Li K', 'Liu Y', 'Chen X']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biomed Eng Online,Biomedical engineering online,101147518,IM,,,,2015/01/21 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1475-925X-14-S1-S12 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-925X-14-S1-S12 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Eng Online. 2015;14 Suppl 1:S12. doi: 10.1186/1475-925X-14-S1-S12.

Twenty office workers (unaware of the study purpose) used six different FPDs, for a week each, at their own desk. These displays were identical apart from the bezel colour (black, white or silver) and shininess (matt or glossy). Participants completed questionnaires about their visual comfort at the end of each week, and were fully debriefed in lunch-time focus groups at the end of the study. For the white and the silver bezels, the glossiness of the bezel was not an issue of concern. The participants were significantly less content with the glossy black surround than with the matt black surround, and in general the glossy black bezel was the least-liked of all those used. With the possible exception of this surround, there was no evidence of significantly increased visual discomfort, indicative of eyestrain, as a result of high or low bezel reflectance, or of high glossiness.","['Howarth, Peter A', 'Hodder, Simon G']","['Howarth PA', 'Hodder SG']","['Environmental Ergonomics Research Centre, Loughborough Design School, Loughborough University, LE11 3TU, United Kingdom.

This paper uses the high-frequency component of the spectral power of accommodative microfluctuations as a major objective indicator for analyzing the effects of visual fatigue based on various displays, such as color-formation displays and 3D displays. Also, a questionnaire is used as a subjective indicator. The results are that 3D videos cause greater visual fatigue than 2D videos (p<0.001), the shutter-type 3D display causes visual fatigue more than the polarized type (p=0.012), the display of the time-sharing method causes greater visual fatigue than the spatial-formation method (p=0.008), and there is no significance between various light source modules of displays (p=0.162). In general, people with normal color discrimination have more visual fatigue than those with good color discrimination (p<0.001). Therefore, this paper uses the high-frequency component of accommodative microfluctuations to evaluate the physiological stress or strain by overexerting the visual system, and can compare the level of visual fatigue between various displays.","['Jeng, Wei-De', 'Ouyang, Yuan', 'Huang, Ting-Wei', 'Duann, Jeng-Ren', 'Chiou, Jin-Chern', 'Tang, Yu-Shun', 'Ou-Yang, Mang']","['Jeng WD', 'Ouyang Y', 'Huang TW', 'Duann JR', 'Chiou JC', 'Tang YS', 'Ou-Yang M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Appl Opt,Applied optics,0247660,IM,,,,2014/10/17 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['298782 [pii]', '10.1364/AO.53.000H76 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Opt. 2014 Oct 10;53(29):H76-84. doi: 10.1364/AO.53.000H76.,,,20150730,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Color', '*Data Display', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/instrumentation/methods', '*Lasers', '*Liquid Crystals', 'Male', 'Photic Stimulation/*instrumentation/methods', 'Task Performance and Analysis', '*Visual Perception']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been previous studies conducted on eye fatigue related to 3D display use, however, most of these have employed a limited number of modalities for measurements, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs), biomedical signals, and eye responses. In this paper, we propose a new assessment of eye fatigue related to 3D display use based on multimodal measurements. compared to previous works Our research is novel in the following four ways: first, to enhance the accuracy of assessment of eye fatigue, we measure EEG signals, eye blinking rate (BR), facial temperature (FT), and a subjective evaluation (SE) score before and after a user watches a 3D display; second, in order to accurately measure BR in a manner that is convenient for the user, we implement a remote gaze-tracking system using a high speed (mega-pixel) camera that measures eye blinks of both eyes; thirdly, changes in the FT are measured using a remote thermal camera, which can enhance the measurement of eye fatigue, and fourth, we perform various statistical analyses to evaluate the correlation between the EEG signal, eye BR, FT, and the SE score based on the T-test, correlation matrix, and effect size. Results show that the correlation of the SE with other data (FT, BR, and EEG) is the highest, while those of the FT, BR, and EEG with other data are second, third, and fourth highest, respectively.","['Bang, Jae Won', 'Heo, Hwan', 'Choi, Jong-Suk', 'Park, Kang Ryoung']","['Bang JW', 'Heo H', 'Choi JS', 'Park KR']","['Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. bangjw@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. gjghks@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. jjongssuk@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. parkgr@dgu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",101204366,IM,,,,2014/09/06 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['s140916467 [pii]', '10.3390/s140916467 [doi]']",epublish,Sensors (Basel). 2014 Sep 4;14(9):16467-85. doi: 10.3390/s140916467.,,20140904,20150623,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', '*Blinking', '*Data Display', 'Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological', 'Electroencephalography/*methods', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*instrumentation', 'Male', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thermography/*methods']",PMC4208183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prolonged accommodative effort has been associated with an increased risk of strabismus (eye misalignment). Strabismus makes it difficult for the eyes to work together and may result in symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain) and intermittent diplopia (double vision), and makes near work tasks difficult to complete. Untreated strabismus may result in the development of amblyopia (lazy eye). The prescription of spectacles to correct hyperopic refractive error is believed to prevent the development of strabismus. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of prescription spectacles compared with no intervention for the prevention of strabismus in infants and children with hyperopia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to April 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2014), PubMed (1966 to April 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 April 2014. We also searched the Science Citation Index database in September 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials investigating the assignment to spectacle intervention or no treatment for children with hyperopia. The definition of hyperopia remains subjective, but we required it to be at least greater than +2.00 diopters (D) of hyperopia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data using the standard methodologic procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. One review author entered data into Review Manager and a second review author verified the data entered. The two review authors resolved discrepancies at all stages of the review process. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three randomized controlled trials (855 children enrolled) in this review. These trials were all conducted in the UK with follow-up periods ranging from one to 3.5 years. We judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias, due to use of quasi-random methods for assigning children to treatment, no masking of outcomes assessors, and high proportions of drop-outs. None of the three trials accounted for missing data and analyses were limited to the available-case data (674 (79%) of 855 children enrolled for the primary outcome). These factors impair our ability to assess the effectiveness of treatment.Analyses incorporating the three trials we identified in this review (674 children) suggested the effect of spectacle correction initiated prior to the age of one year in hyperopic children between three and four years of age is uncertain with respect to preventing strabismus (risk ratio (RR) 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.15; very low quality evidence). Based on a meta-analysis of three trials (664 children), the risk of having visual acuity worse than 20/30 at three years of age was also uncertain for children with spectacles compared with those without spectacle correction irrespective of compliance (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.26; very low quality evidence).Emmetropization was reported in two trials: one trial suggested that spectacles impede emmetropization, and the second trial reported no difference in the rate of refractive error change. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although children who were allocated to the spectacle group were less likely to develop strabismus and less likely to have visual acuity worse than 20/30 children allocated to no spectacles, these effects may have been chance findings, or due to bias. Due to the high risk of bias and poor reporting of included trials, the true effect of spectacle correction for hyperopia on strabismus is still uncertain.","['Jones-Jordan, Lisa', 'Wang, Xue', 'Scherer, Roberta W', 'Mutti, Donald O']","['Jones-Jordan L', 'Wang X', 'Scherer RW', 'Mutti DO']","['College of Optometry, The Ohio State University, 338 West 10th Avenue, 649 Fry Hall, Columbus, Ohio, USA, 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,IM,,,,2014/08/19 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD007738.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 Aug 18;(8):CD007738. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD007738.pub2.,,20140818,20140919,,,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emmetropia', '*Eyeglasses', 'Humans', 'Hyperopia/complications/*rehabilitation', 'Infant', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Strabismus/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vision Disorders/etiology', 'Visual Acuity', '*Watchful Waiting']",PMC4259577,"['U01 EY020522/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', '1 U01 EY020522/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS644929'],['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 Apr 2;4:CD007738.

In line with this, positive associations between eye-related pain and muscle blood flow in orbicularis oculi have been observed. A hypothesis regarding work situations with cognitive tasks and low-level muscle activity, such as computer work, proposes that muscle pain originates from the blood vessel-nociceptor interactions of the connective tissue of the muscle. Noninvasive muscle blood flow measurements in the orbicularis oculi muscle are preferable to using an invasive technique. The aim of this study was to test reproducibility and stability of muscle blood recordings in orbicularis oculi using photoplethysmography. METHODS: In the reproducibility tests, 12 subjects were tested twice within 1 to 5 weeks. To study the stability of the method, six of the subjects were randomly selected and tested four more times within 2 to 6 weeks. Test subjects were doing identical visually demanding computer work for 10 minutes in each test. RESULTS: The short-term repeatability of muscle blood flow measurements was considered good, but the stability of blood flow recordings over time in orbicularis oculi was low because of a greater within-subject maximum variability compared with between-subject average variability. CONCLUSIONS: Investigators should be aware of the effect of time, possibly attributed to confounding factors such as environmental changes and mental stress, when comparing photoplethysmography muscle blood flow recordings.","['Thorud, Hanne-Mari Schiotz', 'Helland, Magne', 'Aaras, Arne', 'Kvikstad, Tor Martin', 'Lindberg, Lars Goran', 'Horgen, Gunnar']","['Thorud HM', 'Helland M', 'Aaras A', 'Kvikstad TM', 'Lindberg LG', 'Horgen G']","['*PhD daggerMSc double daggerPhD, MD Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Buskerud and Vestfold University College, Kongsberg, Norway (H-MST, MH, AA, TMK, GH); and Department of Biomedical Engineering, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden (LGL).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2014/08/12 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0000000000000346 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2014 Sep;91(9):e215-21. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0000000000000346.,,,20141203,,"['Optom Vis Sci. 2015 Jan;92(1):e27.

METHODS: The CISS questionnaire was adapted according to the methodology recommended by some authors. The process involved two translations and back-translations performed by independent evaluators, evaluation of these versions, preparation of a synthesis version and its pre-test. The final version (CISSvp) was applied in 70 patients (21.79 +/- 2.42 years) students in higher education, and at two different times, by two observers, to assess its reliability. RESULTS: The results showed good internal consistency of the CISSvp (Cronbach's alpha - alpha=0.893). The test re-test revealed an average of the differences between the first and second evaluation of 0.75 points (SD +/- 3.53), which indicates a minimum bias between the two administrations. The interrater reliability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.880 to 0.952, revealing that the CISSvp represents an appropriate tool for measuring the visual discomfort associated with near vision tasks with a high level of reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS: The CISS Portuguese version, showed good psychometric properties and has been sown to be applicable to the Portuguese population, to quantify the visual discomfort associated with near vision, in higher education students.","['Tavares, Catarina', 'Nunes, Amelia Maria Monteiro Fernandes', 'Nunes, Antonio Joao Santos', 'Pato, Maria Vaz', 'Monteiro, Pedro Miguel Lourenco']","['Tavares C', 'Nunes AM', 'Nunes AJ', 'Pato MV', 'Monteiro PM']","['Health Sciences Faculty, University of Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Department of Physics, University of Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Research Center, Management and Economics Department, University of Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Health Science Research Centre, FCS, UBI, Portugal.', 'Department of Physics, University of Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Brazil,Arq Bras Oftalmol,Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,0400645,IM,,,,2014/07/31 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/07/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0004-27492014000100021 [pii]', '10.5935/0004-2749.20140007 [doi]']",ppublish,Arq Bras Oftalmol. 2014 Jan-Feb;77(1):21-4. doi: 10.5935/0004-2749.20140007.,,,20150406,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis', 'Brazil', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Language', 'Male', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Psychometrics', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Translations', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Computerized risk assessment systems are available in the market for adoption by companies. OBJECTIVES: The Display Screen Equipment Risk Assessment and Management System was designed for conducting risk assessment and providing intelligent-driven solutions for DSE-related occupational health problems. This report summarizes two consecutive research work conducted on evaluating its effect in reducing body discomfort and mental fatigue, and enhancing sedentary workers' occupational health. METHODS: Convenience sampling was adopted to recruit participants (111 participants for Study 1 and 75 participants for Study 2 who were randomly assigned to an immediate or a delayed intervention group. The intervention was using DSE RAM System to perform a risk assessment followed by an immediate modification of participant's workstation based on the recommendations generated by the System. Face to face interview was conducted and participants completed three sets of questionnaires right before the assessment and two weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: The results of Study 1 revealed that the DSE RAM System was effective for alleviating the discomfort and fatigue levels by rectifying the workstation-worker match. These mismatches were identified to be the heights of monitor, keyboard and chair with the workers. The results of Study 2 indicate that the System was specific for promoting participants to take more frequent rest breaks (OR: 3.65) and pay more attention to occupational safety and health information (OR: 3.90). In particular, the take frequent rest breaks behavior was found to predict decrease in discomfort in the eyes and mental fatigue (lack of energy). Nevertheless, there was no strong evidence on the use of the System can lead to immediate attitudinal changes towards occupational health and safety. CONCLUSION: The findings support the notion that workers' participation and integration of ergonomics into the management are important for successful implementation of occupational health programs. Together with educational and skill training sessions on occupational health at the workplace, the DSE RAM System offers a venue for implementing participatory ergonomics at the workplace.","['Ho, Wan-Yi', 'Sung, Connie Y Y', 'Yu, Qiu-Hua', 'Chan, Chetwyn C H']","['Ho WY', 'Sung CY', 'Yu QH', 'Chan CC']","['Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Ergonomics and Human Performance Laboratory, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology and Special Education, College of Education, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Ergonomics and Human Performance Laboratory, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Ergonomics and Human Performance Laboratory, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['DSE RAM system', 'effectiveness', 'ergonomics', 'occupational health']",,2014/07/19 06:00,2016/05/28 06:00,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['H3NN8QG0250K415G [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-141916 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2014;48(4):471-84. doi: 10.3233/WOR-141916.,,,20160527,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/prevention & control', '*Attitude to Health', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Ergonomics/methods', 'Fatigue/prevention & control', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microcomputers', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/prevention & control', '*Occupational Health', 'Rest', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiments were performed on a computer workstation placed in controlled lighting environment where 2 discomfort glare conditions were modeled. Each participant performed for about 1 h specially designed visual tasks, including the tests with Landolt's rings presented on the screen by a computer program. The glare evaluation method consisted of subjective evaluation of discomfort glare on the semantic glare rating scale, tests of mesopic contrast and glare sensitivity, subjective assessment of lighting quality and asthenopic symptoms. The time needed to perform the task and the number of mistakes were also recorded. The subjective evaluation of glare was compared with the Unified Glare Rating (UGR) index calculated by the DIALux simulation program. RESULTS: A higher percentage of the younger group subjects assessed glare after the experimental session as uncomfortable and intolerable than in the 50+ group, who more often assessed glare as acceptable. The assessment of discomfort glare in the younger group corresponded to higher UGR value compared to UGR value calculated by DIALux. In the 50+ group, such correlation was found only for lower discomfort glare (UGR = 19). The results showed that younger participants more frequently suffered from visual fatigue and assessed lighting as less comfortable. However, the mesopic glare sensitivity increased significantly after the experiments only in the 50+ group under both glare conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results showed that discomfort glare sensation changes with age. The younger population seems to be more sensitive and demanding than the older one in relation to discomfort glare limiting, in spite of the lack of significant objective measures of fatigue. The exposure of the elderly to bigger discomfort glare could adversely affect the objective measures of fatigue like mesopic glare sensitivity and visual performance.","['Wolska, Agnieszka', 'Sawicki, Dariusz']","['Wolska A', 'Sawicki D']","['Department of Safety Engineering, Laboratory of Optical Radiation, Central Institute for Labour Protection - National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB), Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,IM,,,,2014/06/22 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2014/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2478/s13382-014-0257-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2014 Jun;27(3):444-59. doi: 10.2478/s13382-014-0257-9.

Research links direct and indirect glare to increased risk of visual discomfort among office workers with symptoms ranging from dry eyes to blurry vision or headaches. Researchers have been primarily concerned with those characteristics of task lighting that cause glare including luminance level, position (line of sight), and control. It is unknown what the benefits of adjustable task lights are and whether or not their use has an effect on musculoskeletal comfort or posture. No comprehensive field evaluations of this type were found among peer-reviewed, indexed journals. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the ergonomic and calculated utility power consumption benefits of adjustable LED task lighting in an office environment using a control/intervention experiment design. METHODS: One hundred participants were originally recruited and randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Self-reported data was collected on level of eye fatigue, perception of job content, intervention usability, and musculoskeletal discomfort. Data was also collected on workspace level of illumination and posture during standardized tasks (assessed using RULA). RESULTS: Comparing baseline data to follow-up data for the intervention group, the use of the adjustable, LED task lights provided statistically significant, positive impacts on users' rating of discomfort, eye fatigue, perception of job content, and posture between baseline and the short-term follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Significant benefits to musculoskeletal comfort, posture, and visual comfort were documented when participants used the adjustable task lights. Participants' assessments of the light's usability, usefulness and desirability were positive. There were no negative results found with adjustable task light use.","['Joines, Sharon', 'James, Tamara', 'Liu, Siwen', 'Wang, Wenjiao', 'Dunn, Rebecca', 'Cohen, Shane']","['Joines S', 'James T', 'Liu S', 'Wang W', 'Dunn R', 'Cohen S']","['Industrial Design, College of Design, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Ergonomics Division, Occupational & Environmental Safety, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Industrial Design, College of Design, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Industrial Design, College of Design, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Ergonomics Division, Occupational & Environmental Safety, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Bosco Perry Design, LLC, Potomac, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Musculoskeletal', 'discomfort', 'posture', 'usability', 'vision']",,2014/06/19 06:00,2016/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['F25W3LTU368JM403 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-141879 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2015;51(3):471-81. doi: 10.3233/WOR-141879.,,,20161216,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', 'Attitude', 'Conservation of Energy Resources', 'Ergonomics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lighting/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/etiology', 'Posture', '*Workplace', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A pilot questionnaire was created by consulting the literature, clinicians, and video display terminal (VDT) workers. The replies of 636 subjects completing the questionnaire were assessed using the Rasch model and conventional statistics to generate a new scale, designated the Computer-Vision Symptom Scale (CVSS17). Validity and reliability were determined by Rasch fit statistics, principal components analysis (PCA), person separation, differential item functioning (DIF), and item-person targeting. To assess construct validity, the CVSS17 was correlated with a Rasch-based visual discomfort scale (VDS) in 163 VDT workers, this group completed the CVSS17 twice in order to assess test-retest reliability (two-way single-measure intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] and their 95% confidence intervals, and the coefficient of repeatability [COR]). RESULTS: The CVSS17 contains 17 items exploring 15 different symptoms. These items showed good reliability and internal consistency (mean square infit and outfit 0.88-1.17, eigenvalue for the first residual PCA component 1.37, person separation 2.85, and no DIF). Pearson's correlation with VDS scores was 0.60 (P < 0.001). Intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.800-0.887), and COR was 8.14. CONCLUSIONS: The Rasch-based linear-scale CVSS17 emerged as a useful tool to quantify CRVOS in computer workers. : Spanish Abstract.","['Gonzalez-Perez, Mariano', 'Susi, Rosario', 'Antona, Beatriz', 'Barrio, Ana', 'Gonzalez, Enrique']","['Gonzalez-Perez M', 'Susi R', 'Antona B', 'Barrio A', 'Gonzalez E']","['Faculty of Optics and Optometry, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Faculty of Statistical Studies, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Faculty of Optics and Optometry, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Faculty of Optics and Optometry, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Faculty of Optics and Optometry, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['VDT', 'asthenopia', 'computer', 'questionnaire', 'scale']",,2014/06/19 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['iovs.13-13818 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.13-13818 [doi]']",epublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2014 Jun 17;55(7):4504-11. doi: 10.1167/iovs.13-13818.,"['Copyright 2014 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.']",20140617,20140926,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis', '*Computer Terminals', '*Disability Evaluation', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/diagnosis', 'Eye Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Language', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Sickness Impact Profile', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this review is to synthesize the knowledge about ocular and visual alterations related with computer use in contact lens wearers. METHODS: International review of scientific papers (2003-2013) in Spanish and English, using Scoping Review method, in Medline through PubMed and in Scopus. RESULTS: The initial search provided 114 references, after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria six of them were included. All of them reveal that symptoms when using computer are more prevalent in contact lens wearers, with values of symptoms presentation prevalence ranging from 95.0% to 16.9% in wearers and from 57.5% to 9.9% in non-wearers, and four times more likely to develop dry eye [OR: 4.07 (95% CI: 3.52 to 4.71)]. CONCLUSION: Computer workers suffer more ocular and visual disturbances if they also are contact lens users, but studies are few and non conclusive. Likewise, further research regarding contact lens type and their conditions of use, both in symptoms and tear quality and ocular surface are needed.

In a lab-based study with a between-subjects design, 433 viewers aged from 4 to 82 years watched the same movie in either 2D or stereo 3D (S3D), and subjectively reported on a range of aspects of their viewing experience. Our results suggest that a minority of viewers, around 14%, experience adverse effects due to viewing S3D, mainly headache and eyestrain. A control experiment where participants viewed 2D content through 3D glasses suggests that around 8% may report adverse effects which are not due directly to viewing S3D, but instead are due to the glasses or to negative preconceptions about S3D (the 'nocebo effect'). Women were slightly more likely than men to report adverse effects with S3D.

Identification of sleep-related symptoms may help drivers determine their sleepiness, eye symptoms in particular show promise. Sixteen participants completed four motorway drives on two separate occasions. Drives were completed during daytime and night-time in both a driving simulator and on the real road. Ten eye symptoms were rated at the end of each drive, and compared with driving performance and subjective and objective sleep metrics recorded during driving. 'Eye strain', 'difficulty focusing', 'heavy eyelids' and 'difficulty keeping the eyes open' were identified as the four key sleep-related eye symptoms. Drives resulting in these eye symptoms were more likely to have high subjective sleepiness and more line crossings than drives where similar eye discomfort was not reported. Furthermore, drivers having unintentional line crossings were likely to have 'heavy eyelids' and 'difficulty keeping the eyes open'. Results suggest that drivers struggling to identify sleepiness could be assisted with the advice 'stop driving if you feel sleepy and/or have heavy eyelids or difficulty keeping your eyes open'.","['Filtness, Ashleigh J', 'Anund, Anna', 'Fors, Carina', 'Ahlstrom, Christer', 'Akerstedt, Torbjorn', 'Kecklund, Goran']","['Filtness AJ', 'Anund A', 'Fors C', 'Ahlstrom C', 'Akerstedt T', 'Kecklund G']","['Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety - Queensland (CARRS-Q), Queensland University of Technology, Kelvin Grove, Qld, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Sleep Res,Journal of sleep research,9214441,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Karolinska Sleepiness Scale', 'blinks', 'driver drowsiness', 'fatigue', 'road safety']",,2014/05/28 06:00,2015/03/07 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jsr.12163 [doi]'],ppublish,J Sleep Res. 2014 Oct;23(5):568-75. doi: 10.1111/jsr.12163.

Our study is novel in the following four ways: first, the circular area where a user's gaze position exists is defined based on the calculated gaze position and gaze estimation error. Within this circular area, the position where edge strength is maximized can be detected, and we determine this position as the gaze position that has a higher probability of being the correct one. Based on this gaze point, the eye foveation model is defined. Second, we quantitatively evaluate the correlation between the degree of eyestrain and the causal factors of visual fatigue, such as the degree of change of stereoscopic disparity (CSD), stereoscopic disparity (SD), frame cancellation effect (FCE), and edge component (EC) of the 3D stereoscopic display using the eye foveation model. Third, by comparing the eyestrain in conventional 3D video and experimental 3D sample video, we analyze the characteristics of eyestrain according to various factors and types of 3D video. Fourth, by comparing the eyestrain with or without the compensation of eye saccades movement in 3D video, we analyze the characteristics of eyestrain according to the types of eye movements in 3D video. Experimental results show that the degree of CSD causes more eyestrain than other factors.","['Heo, Hwan', 'Lee, Won Oh', 'Shin, Kwang Yong', 'Park, Kang Ryoung']","['Heo H', 'Lee WO', 'Shin KY', 'Park KR']","['Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. gjghks@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. b215p8@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. skyandla@dgu.edu.', 'Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, 26 Pil-dong 3-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul 100-715, Korea. parkgr@dgu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",101204366,IM,,,,2014/05/20 06:00,2015/06/18 06:00,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['s140508577 [pii]', '10.3390/s140508577 [doi]']",epublish,Sensors (Basel). 2014 May 15;14(5):8577-604. doi: 10.3390/s140508577.,,20140515,20150617,,,"['Asthenopia/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological/instrumentation', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Eye Movements/*physiology', '*Eyeglasses', 'Fixation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Fovea Centralis/*anatomy & histology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/instrumentation/methods', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*instrumentation', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted/instrumentation', 'Video Recording/instrumentation']",PMC4063008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case series. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen patients, 7 males and 6 females, with a median age of 32 years (range, 20-59 years) were included. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic small-angle strabismus with stable deviations of no more than 20 prism diopters (PD) in horizontal and 10 PD in vertical were consecutively recruited from the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University between January 2010 and April 2012. Single-stage surgery was performed under topical anaesthesia. Outcome measures were PD, Amblyopia and Strabismus Questionnaire (ASQE) scores, and subjective reduction of symptoms. RESULTS: The median duration of symptoms was 40 months (range, 6-96 months). Nine patients had horizontal deviations, 3 had vertical deviations, and 1 had an exodeviation combined with a vertical deviation. All surgeries were completed without complications, and no patients experienced significant discomfort. All patients reported elimination of symptoms on postoperative day 1. Two patients required a second procedure at 1 week because of a return of symptoms. At 6-month follow-up, no patient reported recurrence of symptoms. The overall ASQE score improved from 70 preoperatively to 96 postoperatively (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest single-stage surgery under topical anaesthesia is an effective treatment for small-angle strabismus. A large, randomized, prospective study to confirm these findings is warranted.","['Zou, Leilei', 'Liu, Rui', 'Liu, Hong', 'Huang, Liwen', 'Liu, Yan', 'Wang, Aihou']","['Zou L', 'Liu R', 'Liu H', 'Huang L', 'Liu Y', 'Wang A']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Eye and ENT Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200031, PR China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Eye and ENT Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200031, PR China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Eye and ENT Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200031, PR China.

Experimental studies show reduced vergence parameters and tonic adaptation. Based upon current models of accommodation and vergence, we hypothesize that the reduced vergence adaptation in CI leads to excessive amounts of convergence accommodation (CA). Eleven CI participants (mean age=17.4+/-2.3 years) were recruited with reduced capacity to view through increasing magnitudes of base out (BO) prisms (mean fusional convergence at 40 cm=12+/-0.9Delta). Testing followed our previous experimental design for (n=11) binocularly normal adults. Binocular fixation of a difference of Gaussian (DoG) target (0.2 cpd) elicited CA responses during vergence adaptation to a 12Delta BO. Vergence and CA responses were obtained at 3 min intervals over a 15 min period and time course were quantified using exponential decay functions. Results were compared to previously published data on eleven binocular normals. Eight participants completed the study. CI's showed significantly reduced magnitude of vergence adaptation (CI: 2.9Delta vs. normals: 6.6Delta; p=0.01) and CA reduction (CI=0.21 D, Normals=0.55 D; p=0.03). However, the decay time constants for adaptation and CA responses were not significantly different. CA changes were not confounded by changes in tonic accommodation (Change in TA=0.01+/-0.2D; p=0.8). The reduced magnitude of vergence adaptation found in CI patients resulting in higher levels of CA may potentially explain their clinical findings of reduced positive fusional vergence (PFV) and the common symptom of blur.","['Sreenivasan, Vidhyapriya', 'Bobier, William R']","['Sreenivasan V', 'Bobier WR']","['School of Optometry, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA.', 'School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

METHODS: Fifteen normal adults without any ocular disease or surgical history watched the same 3D and 2D displays for 30 minutes. Accommodative ability, ocular protection index (OPI), and total ocular symptom scores were evaluated before and after viewing the 3D and 2D displays. Accommodative ability was evaluated by the near point of accommodation (NPA) and OQAS to ensure reliability. The OPI was calculated by dividing the tear breakup time (TBUT) by the interblink interval (IBI). The changes in accommodative ability, OPI, and total ocular symptom scores after viewing 3D and 2D displays were evaluated. RESULTS: Accommodative ability evaluated by NPA and OQAS, OPI, and total ocular symptom scores changed significantly after 3D viewing (p = 0.005, 0.003, 0.006, and 0.003, respectively), but yielded no difference after 2D viewing. The objective measurement by OQAS verified the decrease of accommodative ability while viewing 3D displays. The change of NPA, OPI, and total ocular symptom scores after 3D viewing had a significant correlation (p < 0.05), implying direct associations among these factors. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of accommodative ability after 3D viewing was validated by both subjective and objective methods in our study. Further, the deterioration of accommodative ability and ocular surface stability may be causative factors of visual asthenopia in individuals viewing 3D displays.","['Wee, Sung Wook', 'Moon, Nam Ju']","['Wee SW', 'Moon NJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University Hospital, #224-1, Heukseok-Dong, Dongjak-Gu, Seoul 156-755, Republic of Korea. njmoon@chol.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,BMC Ophthalmol,BMC ophthalmology,100967802,IM,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2415-14-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2415-14-29 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Ophthalmol. 2014 Mar 11;14:29. doi: 10.1186/1471-2415-14-29.,,20140311,20140925,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Blinking/*physiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Depth Perception/*physiology', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Male', 'Photic Stimulation/methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tears/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3995804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 38 volunteers were enrolled, and they watched a 3D display with a 1 degrees or 3 degrees disparity for 30 min at an interval of 1 week. The near point of accommodation (NPA), near point of convergence (NPC) and tear break-up time (tBUT) of each subject were measured before and after watching the 3D display. In addition, the tear meniscus height and depth were measured using Visante optical coherence tomography and tear osmolarity was measured using TearLab osmometer. A survey of subjective symptoms was also conducted. RESULTS: NPA and NPC increased after watching the 3D display (p<0.05). NPC and NPA increased more in the 40s-50s group (i.e., subjects aged in their 40s and 50s) than in the 20s-30s group (ie, subjects aged in their 20s and 30s) after watching 3D content with a 3 degrees disparity (p<0.05). tBUT and tear meniscus height and depth decreased after watching 3D content (p<0.05). They decreased more in the 40s-50s group than in the 20s-30s group after watching 3D content with a 3 degrees disparity (p<0.05). Recovery times of NPA and NPC were significantly greater after watching 3D content with a 3 degrees disparity and in the 40s-50s group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Watching a 3D display affects accommodation and convergence abilities and tear dynamics in a transient fashion, especially in the case of 3D images with a large binocular disparity, and in older subjects. These results provide helpful information for establishment of guidelines for 3D equipment manufacturers.","['Yum, Hae Ri', 'Park, Shin Hae', 'Kang, Hang-Bong', 'Shin, Sun Young']","['Yum HR', 'Park SH', 'Kang HB', 'Shin SY']","[""Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, , Seoul, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Field of Vision', 'Vision', 'Visual Pathway', 'Visual Perception']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['bjophthalmol-2013-304244 [pii]', '10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-304244 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 2014 May;98(5):684-90. doi: 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-304244.

OBJECTIVE: With regard to this article hard arguments and ideas for solutions had to be found. METHODS/PARTICIPANTS: A pilot study in 21 enterprises was realized (1602 employees with different visual work tasks). A test set of screening parameters (visual acuity, refraction, phoria, binocular cooperation and efficiency, accommodation range and color vision) were measured. The glasses and/or contact lenses worn were registered and the visual tasks analyzed. In work at visual display units (VDU) the eye movements were recorded and standardized questionnaires were given (health, stress, visual work situation). Because of the heterogeneity of the sample only simple statistics were applied: in groups of different visual work the complaints, symptoms, hassles and uplifts were clustered (SAS software) and correlated with the results of the visual tests. Later a special project in 8 companies (676 employees) was carried out. The results were published in [14]. RESULTS: Discomfort and asthenopic symptoms could be seen as an interaction of the combination of tasks and working conditions with the clusters of individual functionalisms, frequently originating in postural compromises. Mainly three causes for stress could be identified: 1. demands inadequate with regard to intensity, resolution, amount and/or time structure; 2. prevention of elementary perceptive needs; 3. entire use of partial capacities of the visual organ. Symptoms also were correlated with heteronomy. Other findings: influence of adaptation/accommodation ratio, the distracting role of attractors, especially in multitasking jobs; influence of high luminance differences. Dry eyes were very common, they could be attributed to a high screen position, low light, monotonous tasks and office climate. For some parameters a diurnal rhythm could be identified. Nowhere special programs for ageing employees were found: the right glasses; retinal problems and signs of destabilization of vision. CONCLUSIONS: In all enterprises, the ergophthalmological and visual ergonomic knowledge of the occupational physicians was poor, visual ergonomists were not available and there was only very poor cooperation with ophthalmologists and optometrists, the first of whom additionally had not much knowledge of modern work.","['Mayer, Horst']",['Mayer H'],"[""HECONet, Frankfurt am Main, Germany Stress Research, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany The ICOH subcommittee 'Functional Aspects of Vision at Work'""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Ageing workforce', 'cooperation between experts and enterprises', 'efficiency of expert work on-site', 'environmental factors', 'ergophthalmology', 'visual ergonomics']",,2014/01/23 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['B1411861G1P0K602 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-141822 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2014 Jan 1;47(3):353-64. doi: 10.3233/WOR-141822.,,,20150413,,,"['Asthenopia/etiology', 'Computer Terminals', '*Ergonomics', 'Humans', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/etiology', '*Occupational Health', '*Ophthalmology', 'Professional Competence', '*Professional Role', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'Vision, Ocular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24413278,NLM,MEDLINE,20181202,1538-9235 (Electronic) 1040-5488 (Linking),91,3,2014 Mar,Blink patterns: reading from a computer screen versus hard copy.,297-302,10.1097/OPX.0000000000000157 [doi],"PURPOSE: Many subjects experience ocular and visual symptoms during computer use. Previous studies have reported a reduced blink rate during computer operation and suggested that this may account for some of the symptoms, particularly dry eye. However, these earlier investigations failed to include an appropriate control condition. To determine whether it is computer screen viewing that produces the change in blink rate, the present study compared blink patterns when reading from either a desktop computer monitor or a hard copy printed text under equivalent viewing conditions. METHODS: Subjects (N = 25) were required to perform a continuous 20-minute reading task from either a desktop computer screen or a printed hard copy page at a viewing distance of 50 cm. Identical text was used in the two sessions, which was matched for size and contrast. Target viewing angle and luminance were similar for the two conditions. Subjects were videotaped during the task to determine their blink rate and amplitude. Immediately after the task, subjects completed a questionnaire regarding ocular symptoms experienced during the trial. RESULTS: Mean blink rates for the computer and hard copy conditions were 14.9 and 13.6 blinks per minute, respectively (p = 0.58). However, a significantly higher percentage of incomplete blinks was observed for the computer condition (7.02 vs. 4.33%; p = 0.02). No significant correlation was found between the symptom score and the percentage of incomplete blinks. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with an equivalent hard copy control condition, blink rates were not reduced during computer operation. It is proposed that the previously observed differences in blink rate are more likely to be produced by changes in cognitive demand rather than the method of presentation. However, a higher percentage of incomplete blinks was noted during computer operation, which may have been associated with visual fatigue.","['Chu, Christina A', 'Rosenfield, Mark', 'Portello, Joan K']","['Chu CA', 'Rosenfield M', 'Portello JK']","['*OD, MS daggerMCOptom, PhD, FAAO double daggerOD, MS, MPH, FAAO State University of New York, College of Optometry, New York, New York (all authors).']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/04/26 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0000000000000157 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2014 Mar;91(3):297-302. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0000000000000157.,,,20140425,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis', 'Blinking/*physiology', '*Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mass Media', '*Reading', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This field study was conducted between March and May 2013, in three packing plants (Saveh, central Iran). Data were collected by questionnaire and measurement of the task area illuminance levels. Data were analysed using contingency coefficient test, Spearman's correlation analysis and non-parametric Friedman tests. RESULTS: The recommended illuminance levels were not met in 46.9% of the work areas. This finding was in agreement with the employees' perception of light level, and with low satisfaction with lighting in the work environment. Adverse effects of lighting condition on job performance, changing posture for better viewing of the work area and eye tiredness were reported as 64%, 33% and 31% of the employees, respectively. Satisfaction with lighting was negatively correlated with the age of respondents (r=-0.229; P<0.010). The employees' satisfaction with lighting was also highly correlated with the employees' subjective assessments of the light level (r=0.779; P<0.001), type of artificial light sources (r=0.591; P<0.001), light colour (r=0.50; P<0.001) and use of daylight (r=0.254; P<0.004). The type of artificial light sources was correlated with job performance (r=0.311, P<0.001) and eye tiredness (r=0.273; P<0.002).

The aim of the present research was to study the effects of the display technology on visual fatigue. To this end, participants performed a longitudinal study in which two last generation e-readers (LCD, E-ink) and paper book were tested in three different prolonged reading sessions separated by--on average--ten days. Results from both objective (Blinks per second) and subjective (Visual Fatigue Scale) measures suggested that reading on the LCD (Kindle Fire HD) triggers higher visual fatigue with respect to both the E-ink (Kindle Paperwhite) and the paper book.

However, the poor performance of high-frequency SSVEP requires a novel stimulus of better performance even with low eye fatigue. As an alternative to the high-frequency SSVEP, we explore the SSVEP response to an amplitude-modulated stimulus (AM-SSVEP) to verify its availability for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). METHODS: An amplitude-modulated stimulus was generated as the product of two sine waves at a carrier frequency (fc) and a modulating frequency (fm). The carrier frequency was higher than 40 Hz to reduce eye fatigue, and the modulating frequency ranged around the alpha-band (9-12 Hz) to utilize low-frequency harmonic information. Four targets were used in combinations of three different modulating frequencies and two different carrier frequencies in the offline experiment, and two additional targets were added with one additional modulating and one carrier frequency in online experiments. RESULTS: In the AM-SSVEP spectra, seven harmonic components were identified at 2fc, 2fm, fc+/-fm, fc+/-3fm, and 2fc-4fm. Using an optimized combination of the harmonic frequencies, online experiments demonstrated that the accuracy of the AM-SSVEP was equivalent to that of the low-frequency SSVEP. Furthermore, subject evaluation indicated that an AM stimulus caused lower eye fatigue and less sensing of flickering than a low-frequency stimulus, in a manner similar to a high-frequency stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: The actual stimulus frequencies of AM-SSVEPs are in the high-frequency band, resulting in reduced eye fatigue. Furthermore, AM-SSVEPs can utilize both fundamental stimulus frequencies and non-integer harmonic frequencies including low frequencies for SSVEP recognition. The feasibility of AM-SSVEP with high BCI performance and low eye fatigue was confirmed through offline and online experiments. SIGNIFICANCE: AM-SSVEPs combine the advantages of both low- and high-frequency SSVEPs--high power and low eye fatigue, respectively. AM-SSVEP-based BCI systems exploit these advantages, making them promising for application in practical BCI systems.","['Chang, Min Hye', 'Baek, Hyun Jae', 'Lee, Seung Min', 'Park, Kwang Suk']","['Chang MH', 'Baek HJ', 'Lee SM', 'Park KS']","['Interdisciplinary Program for Bioengineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'DMC R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Co.

METHODS: This was a questionnaire based prospective study where 1283 males and females from different professions and companies answered a baseline questionnaire about individual factors and working conditions, e.g. duration of daily computer work, comfort of screen work, psychosocial factors. Subjects were at baseline and 10 follow-ups asked about the number of days with eye-symptoms during the preceding month. RESULTS: The incidence-rate of symptoms persisting minimum three days was 0.38/person-year. A multivariate Hazard-ratio model showed significant associations with extended continuous computer work, tasks with high demands on eye-hand coordination, low level of control, visual discomfort, female sex and nicotine use. Eye-symptoms at baseline was a strong risk factor for new symptoms. CONCLUSION: The incidence of eye-symptoms among professional computer users is high and related to both individual and work-related factors. The organization of computer work should secure frequent breaks from near-work at the computer screen. The severity of vision-related problems could in field studies be quantified by asking for the persistence of symptoms.","['Toomingas, A', 'Hagberg, M', 'Heiden, M', 'Richter, H', 'Westergren, K E', 'Tornqvist, E Wigaeus']","['Toomingas A', 'Hagberg M', 'Heiden M', 'Richter H', 'Westergren KE', 'Tornqvist EW']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Occupational and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Occupational Studies, University of Gavle, Gavle, Sweden.', 'Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Occupational and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Occupational Studies, University of Gavle, Gavle, Sweden.', 'Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Occupational and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Occupational Studies, University of Gavle, Gavle, Sweden.', 'Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Occupational and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Occupational Studies, University of Gavle, Gavle, Sweden.', 'Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Occupational and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Occupational Studies, University of Gavle, Gavle, Sweden School of Health Sciences, Jonkoping University, Jonkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Office work', 'eye strain', 'prospective study', 'visual ergonomics']",,2013/11/29 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['F121J1301K400271 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-131778 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2014 Jan 1;47(3):291-301. doi: 10.3233/WOR-131778.,,,20150413,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*epidemiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research has shown a connection between eyestrain and upper-body musculoskeletal discomfort in general, including postal workers. A previous study of postal workers found that most of those with eye strain were in need of a new correction in their existing spectacles. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate intervention effects on eyestrain and musculoskeletal discomfort with new spectacles for postal workers. METHODS: Postal workers subjectively reported eyestrain, musculoskeletal discomfort and their opinions of the visual environment via questionnaires pre- and post-intervention. After an eye examination the postal workers were divided into two groups: those who needed new spectacles and those who did not. RESULTS: Those who needed new spectacles showed a higher prevalence of eyestrain and musculoskeletal discomfort pre-intervention. Post-intervention, the postal workers rated their vision better and the average eyestrain and musculoskeletal discomfort decreased for both groups. These workers also experienced a decrease in discomfort on the left (static) side of the neck while sorting mail. CONCLUSION: An intervention providing the optimal correction reduces eyestrain and decreases musculoskeletal discomfort, especially from the neck.","['Hemphala, H', 'Nylen, P', 'Eklund, J']","['Hemphala H', 'Nylen P', 'Eklund J']","['Division of Ergonomics and Aerosol Technology, Department of Design Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Ergonomics, School of Technology and Health, Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Ergonomics, School of Technology and Health, Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Mail', 'dynamic', 'glasses', 'lenses', 'neck', 'static', 'visual ergonomics', 'work posture']",,2013/11/29 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['54841KT605749867 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-131773 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2014 Jan 1;47(3):329-37. doi: 10.3233/WOR-131773.,,,20150413,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*prevention & control', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/*prevention & control', 'Occupational Diseases/*prevention & control', '*Postal Service', 'Posture', 'Vision Disorders/therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But only moderate or low level of evidence exists in support of this view. Inconclusive evidence does not, however, equal negative evidence. The accommodation/vergence system does exhibit signs of overload in contemporary working life, including eye discomfort, transient myopia, altered pattern of eye-lens oscillations, and associated phoria. Accommodation/vergence overload, caused by non-ergonomic near work, may also emerge as quickly as within one regular workday. Long-term musculoskeletal consequences of high accommodation/vergence demands have nevertheless not yet been studied in any detail. A research agenda which aims to provide multi-scientific evidence for eye-neck/shoulder interactions with public health implications and which also, in addition, study the eye-neck/shoulder mechanisms and elucidates the operating characteristics, should consequently be highly warranted. This new knowledge would be useful for physiotherapists, ergonomists and opticians, who in their profession treat patients experiencing vision- and musculoskeletal disorders. If both visual and the musculoskeletal aspects are given full and equal weight in the design and evaluation of work places, it is predicted to lead to an improved quality of life for the individual worker, and an enhanced productivity for the employer.","['Richter, Hans O']",['Richter HO'],"['Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, University of Gavle, S-801 76 Gavle, Sweden.

However, some individuals report increased visual symptoms when reading from electronic screens. OBJECTIVE: This investigation compared reading from two electronic devices (Amazon Kindle or Apple Ipod) versus hardcopy text in two groups of 20 subjects. METHODS: Subjects performed a 20 min reading task for each condition. Both the accommodative response and reading rate were monitored during the trial. Immediately post-task, subjects completed a questionnaire concerning the ocular symptoms experienced during the task. RESULTS: In comparing the Kindle with hardcopy, no significant difference in the total symptom score was observed, although the mean score for the symptoms of tired eyes and eye discomfort was significantly higher with the Kindle. No significant differences in reading rate were found. When comparing the Ipod with hardcopy, no significant differences in symptom scores were found. The mean reading rate with the Ipod was significantly slower than for hardcopy while the mean lag of accommodation was significantly larger for the Ipod. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significant increase in symptoms with the Kindle, and larger lag of accommodation and reduced reading rate with the Ipod, one may conclude that reading from electronic devices is not equivalent to hardcopy.","['Hue, Jennifer E', 'Rosenfield, Mark', 'Saa, Gianinna']","['Hue JE', 'Rosenfield M', 'Saa G']","['SUNY College of Optometry, New York, NY, USA.', 'SUNY College of Optometry, New York, NY, USA.', 'SUNY College of Optometry, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation', 'Ipod', 'Kindle', 'computer vision syndrome']",,2013/11/29 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['X44928543N587641 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-131777 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2014 Jan 1;47(3):303-7. doi: 10.3233/WOR-131777.,,,20150413,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', '*Computers, Handheld', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Paper', '*Reading', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From April to September 2012, 1 500 students from five universities in Xi'an were selected according to a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. Data on demographic features, lifestyle or dietary habits, health status, living environment conditions, sleep and mental status, and asthenopia symptoms were collected through a self-administered validated questionnaire. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis modified by the factor analysis were performed to evaluate risk factors for asthenopia. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the college students complained of asthenopia. Statistically significant risk factors for asthenopia in the univariate analysis included 13 variables. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between the use of computer and asthenopia (OR 1.21, 95%CI: 1.09 to 1.35). Good sleep and mental status (OR 0.86, 95%CI: 0.76 to 0.97), good living environment conditions (OR 0.67, 95%CI: 0.60 to 0.76), and high intake of green leafy vegetables (OR 0.89, 95%CI: 0.80 to 0.98) were found to be strong predictors of decreasing the occurrence of asthenopia complaints.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of CVS symptoms, knowledge and practices of computer use in students studying in different universities in Malaysia, and to evaluate the association of various factors in computer use with the occurrence of symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cross sectional, questionnaire survey study, data was collected in college students regarding the demography, use of spectacles, duration of daily continuous use of computer, symptoms of CVS, preventive measures taken to reduce the symptoms, use of radiation filter on the computer screen, and lighting in the room. RESULTS: A total of 795 students, aged between 18 and 25 years, from five universities in Malaysia were surveyed. The prevalence of symptoms of CVS (one or more) was found to be 89.9%; the most disturbing symptom was headache (19.7%) followed by eye strain (16.4%). Students who used computer for more than 2 hours per day experienced significantly more symptoms of CVS (p=0.0001). Looking at far objects in-between the work was significantly (p=0.0008) associated with less frequency of CVS symptoms. The use of radiation filter on the screen (p=0.6777) did not help in reducing the CVS symptoms. CONCLUSION: Ninety percent of university students in Malaysia experienced symptoms related to CVS, which was seen more often in those who used computer for more than 2 hours continuously per day.","['Reddy, S C', 'Low, C K', 'Lim, Y P', 'Low, L L', 'Mardina, F', 'Nursaleha, M P']","['Reddy SC', 'Low CK', 'Lim YP', 'Low LL', 'Mardina F', 'Nursaleha MP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Nepal,Nepal J Ophthalmol,Nepalese journal of ophthalmology : a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal of the Nepal Ophthalmic Society : NEPJOPH,101505288,IM,,,,2013/11/01 06:00,2015/03/11 06:00,['2013/11/01 06:00'],"['2013/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3126/nepjoph.v5i2.8707 [doi]'],ppublish,Nepal J Ophthalmol. 2013 Jul-Dec;5(2):161-8. doi: 10.3126/nepjoph.v5i2.8707.,['(c) NEPjOPH.'],,20150310,['0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)'],,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Computers', 'Ergonomics/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Headache/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Ophthalmic Solutions/administration & dosage', 'Prevalence', 'Students/*statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Syndrome', 'Universities', 'Visual Acuity', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of fatigue-fatigue in the central nervous system and subjective visual fatigue-were evaluated using a critical fusion frequency test and a questionnaire administered to 17 male radiologists before and after soft-copy reading. Reading-induced fatigue was assumed to be affected by 20 hypothetical factors associated with personal characteristics, time required for reading, content or amount of reading, and the reading environment. We used multiple linear regression analysis with a variable selection method to detect the best combination of factors capable of expressing variations in each of the measured fatigue values. The effects of the detected (dominant) factors on fatigue were also examined based on coefficients of the dominant factors in multiple regression models. RESULTS: Fatigue in the central nervous system decreased with a higher corrected visual acuity and a higher ambient illuminance in the reading room and was also affected by the type of monitor used. Visual fatigue was relieved when there was a larger difference in the brightness of the monitor and the surfaces surrounding the monitor and tended to be more severe when glasses rather than contact lenses were worn. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the ambient illuminance, using an appropriate type of monitor, improving the corrected visual acuity, and using contact lenses rather than eyeglasses could help decrease reading-induced fatigue in male radiologists.","['Ikushima, Yoichiro', 'Yabuuchi, Hidetake', 'Morishita, Junji', 'Honda, Hiroshi']","['Ikushima Y', 'Yabuuchi H', 'Morishita J', 'Honda H']","['Department of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka City, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.

Whether viewing 3D displays can evoke measureable emotional responses, however, is uncertain. In the present study, we examined autonomic nervous system responses in subjects viewing 2D or 3D displays. Autonomic responses were quantified in each subject by heart rate, galvanic skin response, and skin temperature. Viewers of both 2D and 3D displays showed strong positive correlations with heart rate, which indicated little differences between groups. In contrast, galvanic skin response and skin temperature showed weak positive correlations with average difference between viewing 2D and 3D. We suggest that galvanic skin response and skin temperature can be used to measure and compare autonomic nervous responses in subjects viewing 2D and 3D displays.","['Kim, Chi Jung', 'Park, Sangin', 'Won, Myeung Ju', 'Whang, Mincheol', 'Lee, Eui Chul']","['Kim CJ', 'Park S', 'Won MJ', 'Whang M', 'Lee EC']","['Department of Emotion Engineering, Graduate School, Sangmyung University, 7 Hongji-Dong, Jongno-Ku, Seoul 110-743, Korea. eclee@smu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",101204366,IM,,,,2013/10/01 06:00,2014/04/04 06:00,['2013/10/01 06:00'],"['2013/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['s131013054 [pii]', '10.3390/s131013054 [doi]']",epublish,Sensors (Basel). 2013 Sep 26;13(10):13054-62. doi: 10.3390/s131013054.,,20130926,20140403,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Autonomic Nervous System/*physiopathology', '*Cognitive Reserve', 'Data Display', 'Female', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*adverse effects/methods', 'Male', 'Photic Stimulation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin Temperature']",PMC3859049,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An intervention study was conducted with 24 office workers lasting 6 weeks with three consecutive phases (before, 1 and 5 weeks after the intervention). Employees used a purpose-made website for adjusting their computer workplaces without any personal support of ergonomics experts. Workplace measurements were taken directly on site and by analysing photos taken of the employee. Self-reported complaints were assessed by filling in a questionnaire. It was found that 96% of the employees changed their workplaces on their own and retained them mostly unchanged after the intervention. Furthermore, self-reported musculoskeletal complaints and headache symptoms decreased significantly after the intervention. These findings suggest an improvement of workplace conditions so that cost-effective ergonomic Web-based interventions appear promising in further research and application.","['Meinert, Marina', 'Konig, Mirjam', 'Jaschinski, Wolfgang']","['Meinert M', 'Konig M', 'Jaschinski W']","['a Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors , D-44139 , Dortmund , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,,,,2013/10/01 06:00,2014/08/02 06:00,['2013/10/01 06:00'],"['2013/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/00140139.2013.835872 [doi]'],ppublish,Ergonomics. 2013;56(11):1658-68. doi: 10.1080/00140139.2013.835872.

METHODS: Fifteen patients with near vision asthenopia and intermittent exotropia of the convergence insufficiency type were included in this prospective study. The upper edge of the MR was resected more than the lower edge. Slanted bilateral or unilateral medial rectus resection was performed. The mean length of follow-up was 14.9 months. RESULTS: Slanted medial rectus resection(s) caused a significant postoperative reduction in the mean distance exodeviation from 11.40 to 4.53 PD, as well as a change in the mean near exodeviation from 23.93 to 10.73 PD. Although mean near-distance difference reduced from 12.53 to 6.2 PD. In final examination, 11 patients showed surgical success rate and recurrent exotropia occurred in 4 cases. On the other hand, 13 cases had experienced significant relief from their symptoms. CONCLUSION: Slanted medial rectus resection is useful in decreasing the symptoms of intermittent exotropia of the convergence insufficiency type. However, it can result in undercorrection in larger deviations.","['Akbari, Mohammad Reza', 'Masoomian, Babak', 'Jafari, Alireza Keshtcar', 'Fard, Masoud Aghsaei', 'Ameri, Ahmad', 'Sadeghi, Arash Mirmohammad']","['Akbari MR', 'Masoomian B', 'Jafari AK', 'Fard MA', 'Ameri A', 'Sadeghi AM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Binocul Vis Strabolog Q Simms Romano,"Binocular vision & strabology quarterly, Simms-Romano's",101556982,IM,,,,2013/09/26 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2013/09/26 06:00'],"['2013/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Binocul Vis Strabolog Q Simms Romano. 2013;28(3):159-66.,,,20160422,,,"['*Exotropia', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ocular Motility Disorders', 'Oculomotor Muscles', '*Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Pre- and post-task vergence dynamics to a 10.3 degrees disparity stimulus were recorded objectively in 12 adult, asymptomatic individuals for both convergence and divergence. There were two fatigue-inducing tasks: Congruent or C-task: Subjects altered bifixation (50 cycles) between reduced Snellen charts at 2 m and at 20 cm every 3 s. Non-congruent or NC task: Subjects performed 50 cycles of vergence flipper (7Delta BO/BI), while bifixating a reduced Snellen chart at 40 cm. Pre- and post-task mean amplitude, time constant, peak velocity, and steady-state response variability were compared. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in mean post-task, steady-state response variability for both the C and NC tasks. However, there were no significant group differences for either convergence or divergence between the pre- and post-mean amplitude, time constant, and peak velocity parameters for both the C and NC tasks, although post-task peak velocity was consistently reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Steady-state vergence response variability was found to be the critical objective parameter to demonstrate significant fatigue effects in the group. Peak velocity was also consistently reduced to a small extent in the NC task. We speculate that these fatigue effects are of a central, and not of peripheral, origin.","['Thiagarajan, Preethi', 'Ciuffreda, Kenneth J']","['Thiagarajan P', 'Ciuffreda KJ']","['Department of Biological and Vision Sciences, State College of Optometry, State University of New York (SUNY), New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'eye movements', 'oculomotor control', 'vergence', 'vergence dynamics', 'visual fatigue']",,2013/09/17 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/opo.12083 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2013 Nov;33(6):642-51. doi: 10.1111/opo.12083.

METHODS: This study was conducted prospectively between October 2007 and March 2009. A total of 1002 spectacles of 1002 individuals were included in the study. First right and then left lenses of the spectacles were measured with a Topcon CL-200 digital lensmeter. Interpupillary distance (PD) of the subjects was measured. Spherical, cylindrical, and axial differences between the prescription and the spectacles were separately calculated for the left and right lenses. Prismatic effect (PE) of the lenses, with decentralized focus according to the pupil, its base direction, and amount of decentralization, were measured. RESULTS: A total of 505 (50.4%) of the subjects were female and 497 (49.6%) were male. The mean age was 37.0 (range 3-81). The mean PD of the subjects was 59.9 +/- 4.09 mm, and mean optical center distance (OCD) of the lenses was 65.6 +/- 4.07 mm. The difference between PD and OCD was significant (p < 0.001). While the right spherical, cylindrical, and axial differences and left spherical, cylindrical, and axial differences between the prescription and the spectacles were not significant, the left axial difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The decentralization direction was towards the lower temporal with a percentage of 76.8% on the right and 80.3% on the left lenses. The mean amount of the decentralization was 4.37 +/- 2.39 mm on the right and 4.63 +/- 2.36 mm on the left. CONCLUSION: Dioptric error in the spectacles was quite low. However, there may be a small amount of axis deviation at the time of mounting the lens to the frame. We conclude that asthenopic complaints due to PE caused by the decentralization of the optic center of the lenses are quite important. Examination of the spectacles after they are prepared can be deemed as a solution to reduce asthenopic complaints due to improper spectacles.","['Ilhan, Nilufer', 'Dogan, Hakki', 'Ilhan, Ozgur', 'Coskun, Mesut', 'Bulut, Betul Tasar', 'Ersekerci, Tulay Karacan']","['Ilhan N', 'Dogan H', 'Ilhan O', 'Coskun M', 'Bulut BT', 'Ersekerci TK']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Mustafa Kemal University , Hatay , Turkey .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Semin Ophthalmol,Seminars in ophthalmology,8610759,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'prescription', 'prismatic effect', 'refractive error', 'spectacles']",,2013/08/21 06:00,2015/06/26 06:00,['2013/08/20 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08820538.2013.810287 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Ophthalmol. 2015 Jan;30(1):29-35. doi: 10.3109/08820538.2013.810287.

METHODS: Patients with strabismus, amblyopia, or anisometropia older than 9 years were recruited for the ABV group (98 subjects). Normal volunteers were enrolled in the control group (32 subjects). Best-corrected visual acuity, refractive errors, angle of strabismus, and stereoacuity were measured. After watching 3D TV for 20 min, a survey was conducted to evaluate the degree of 3D perception, and ocular and systemic discomfort while watching 3D TV. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty subjects were enrolled in this study. The ABV group included 49 patients with strabismus, 22 with amblyopia, and 27 with anisometropia. The ABV group showed worse stereoacuity at near and distant fixation (P<0.001). Ocular and systemic discomfort was, however, not different between the two groups. Fifty-three subjects in the ABV group and all subjects in the control group showed good stereopsis (60 s of arc or better at near), and they reported more dizziness, headache, eye fatigue, and pain (P<0.05) than the other 45 subjects with decreased stereopsis. The subjects with good stereopsis in the ABV group felt more eye fatigue than those in the control group (P=0.031). The subjects with decreased stereopsis showed more difficulty with 3D perception (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The subjects with abnormal stereopsis showed decreased 3D perception while watching 3D TV.

This paper should answer a few questions about their correction, flowing from theoretical presumptions and expectations of this dilemma. The main goal of this research was to (dis)confirm the hypothesis about convenience, efficiency and frequency of the correction that do not raise the visual acuity (or if the improvement isn't noticeable). The next goal was to examine the connection between this correction and other factors (age, size of the refractive error, etc.). The last aim was to describe the subjective personal rating of the correction of these small refractive errors, and to determine the minimal improvement of the visual acuity, that is attractive enough for the client to purchase the correction (glasses, contact lenses). It was confirmed, that there's an indispensable group of subjects with good visual acuity, where the correction is applicable, although it doesn't improve the visual acuity much. The main importance is to eliminate the asthenopia. The prime reason for acceptance of the correction is typically changing during the life, so as the accommodation is declining. Young people prefer the correction on the ground of the asthenopia, caused by small refractive error or latent strabismus; elderly people acquire the correction because of improvement of the visual acuity. Generally the correction was found useful in more than 30%, if the gain of the visual acuity was at least 0,3 of the decimal row.","['Skrbek, Matej', 'Petrova, Sylvie']","['Skrbek M', 'Petrova S']","['Department of Optometry and Orthoptics, Masaryk University, Faculty of Medicine, Brno, Czech Republic. matejskrbek@seznam.cz']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Croatia,Coll Antropol,Collegium antropologicum,8003354,IM,,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Coll Antropol. 2013 Apr;37 Suppl 1:209-16.,,,20130723,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Refractive Errors/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Three months postoperatively, uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, reaching 20/20 binocularly. Monocular and binocular uncorrected near visual acuity of 20/20 was achieved without symptoms of asthenopia in prolonged reading. There were no changes in nystagmus characteristics after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocal intraocular lens implantation to manage a case of clinically significant acquired nystagmus may be a safe alternative, especially if others options have failed.","['Amigo, Alfredo', 'Bonaque, Sergio']","['Amigo A', 'Bonaque S']","['Instituto Oftalmologico Amigo, Tenerife, Spain. amigo@ioamigo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Refract Surg,"Journal of refractive surgery (Thorofare, N.J. : 1995)",9505927,IM,,,,2013/07/04 06:00,2013/08/14 06:00,['2013/07/04 06:00'],"['2013/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/1081597X-20130617-10 [doi]'],ppublish,J Refract Surg. 2013 Jul;29(7):506-8. doi: 10.3928/1081597X-20130617-10.,"['Copyright 2013, SLACK Incorporated.']",,20130813,,,"['Contact Lenses', 'Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lens Implantation, Intraocular', '*Lenses, Intraocular', 'Middle Aged', 'Nystagmus, Pathologic/*surgery', '*Phacoemulsification', 'Refraction, Ocular/physiology', 'Vision Disorders/*rehabilitation', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology', 'Visual Acuity/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to compare the accommodative response under monocular and binocular conditions in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants with different near phorias. METHODS: Seventy students at Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Iran (mean age: 21.2 +/- 1.7 years; age range: 18 to 25 years) participated. The participants were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups according to the convergence insufficiency symptom survey questionnaire score. The type and magnitude of the near dissociated phoria were determined using the prism neutralised cover test. The accommodative lag was measured by the 'monocular estimate method' (MEM) retinoscopy, at first under binocular and then monocular conditions. Testing distance was 40 cm. RESULTS: The accommodative lag in exophoric participants was lower under binocular conditions compared to monocular and in esophoric participants greater under binocular than under monocular conditions. The binocular accommodative response (AR) was greatest in participants with high exophoria at near vision and least in participants with esophoria at near vision (p < 0.001; one-way analysis of variance). The difference between binocular lag and monocular lag was significantly greater in symptomatic participants than in asymptomatic participants in both exophoria (p < 0.001) and esophoria (p = 0.009) (independent samples t-test). CONCLUSION: The near binocular accommodative response was related to near heterophoria. Higher levels of vergence accommodation, resulting in differences in lag under monocular and binocular conditions, may be a factor in near point asthenopia.","['Momeni-Moghaddam, Hamed', 'Goss, David A', 'Sobhani, Mina']","['Momeni-Moghaddam H', 'Goss DA', 'Sobhani M']","['Health Promotion Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. hmomeni_opt@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Clin Exp Optom,Clinical & experimental optometry,8703442,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CISS', 'accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'lag of accommodation', 'phoria']",,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/08/26 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cxo.12074 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Optom. 2014 Jan;97(1):36-42. doi: 10.1111/cxo.12074.

Increased use of computers has led to an increase in the number of patients with ocular complaints which are being grouped together as computer vision syndrome (CVS). In view of that, this study was undertaken to find out the ocular complaints and the factors contributing to occurrence of such problems in computer users. AIMS: To evaluate the factors contributing to Ocular complaints in computer users in Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, U.P. India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Community-based cross-sectional study of 150 subjects who work on computer for varying period of time in Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred computer operators working in different institutes offices and bank of were selected randomly in Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, and Uttar Pradesh. 16 were non responders 18 did not come for assessment and 16 were excluded due to complaints prior to computer use making no response rate Twenty-one did not participate in the study, making the no response rate 25%. Rest of the subjects (n = 150) were asked to fill a pre-tested questionnaire, after obtaining their verbal consent Depending on the average hours of usage in a day, they were categorized into three categories viz. <2 hrs, 2-6 hrs, >6 hrs of usage. All the responders were asked to come to the Ophthalmic OPD for further interview and assessment. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Simple proportions and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Among the 150 subjects studied major ocular complaint reported in descending order were eyestrain. (53%). Occurrence of eye strain, ( 53.8%), itching ( 47.6%) and burning (66.7%) in subjects using computer for more than 6 hours. distance from computer screen with respect to eyes, use of antiglare screen, taking frequent breaks, use of LCD monitor and adjustment of brightness of monitor screen bear a significant association with these ocular complaints in computer users. CONCLUSIONS: Eye strain is the most common ocular complaints among computer users working for more than 6 hours a day. We also found that maintaining ideal distance from screen, keeping level of eyes above the top of screen, taking frequent breaks, using LCD monitors and using antiglare screen and adjusting brightness levels according to workplace reduced these ocular complaints to a significant level.","['Agarwal, Smita', 'Goel, Dishanter', 'Sharma, Anshu']","['Agarwal S', 'Goel D', 'Sharma A']","['Assistant Professor, Department of Ophthalmology.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Eyestrain', 'Ocular complaints']",,2013/04/02 06:00,2013/04/02 06:01,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2013/5150.2760 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2013 Feb;7(2):331-5. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5150.2760.

The purpose of this study was the determination of the relationship between thermal comfort and light intensity with the sleep quality and eye fatigue in shift nurses. METHOD: This cross-sectional research was conducted on 82 shift-work personnel of 18 nursing workstations in Isfahan Al-Zahra Hospital, Iran, in 2012. Heat stress monitoring (WBGT) and photometer (Hagner Model) were used for measuring the thermal conditions and illumination intensity, respectively. To measure the sleep quality, visual tiredness, and thermal comfort, Pittsburg sleep quality index, eye fatigue questionnaire, and thermal comfort questionnaire were used, respectively. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, and Pearson correlation. RESULTS: Correlation between thermal comfort which was perceived from the self-reporting of people with eye tiredness was -0.38 (P = 0.002). Pearson correlation between thermal comfort and sleep quality showed a positive and direct relationship (r = 0.241, P = 0.33) but the correlation between thermal comfort, which was perceived from the self-reporting of shift nurses, and WBGT index was a weak relationship (r = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Based on the obtained findings, it can be concluded that a defect in environmental conditions such as thermal conditions and light intensity and also lack of appropriate managerial plan for night shift-work nurses are destructive and negative factors for the physical and mental health of this group of practitioners.","['Azmoon, Hiva', 'Dehghan, Habibollah', 'Akbari, Jafar', 'Souri, Shiva']","['Azmoon H', 'Dehghan H', 'Akbari J', 'Souri S']","['Occupational Health Engineering Department, School of Health, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan 81746, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Environ Public Health,Journal of environmental and public health,101516361,IM,,,,2013/03/12 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/639184 [doi]'],ppublish,J Environ Public Health. 2013;2013:639184. doi: 10.1155/2013/639184.

A prospective crossover observational study on visually induced motion sickness.,e56160,10.1371/journal.pone.0056160 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The increasing popularity of commercial movies showing three dimensional (3D) images has raised concern about possible adverse side effects on viewers. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective carryover observational study was designed to assess the effect of exposure (3D vs. 2D movie views) on self reported symptoms of visually induced motion sickness. The standardized Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was self administered on a convenience sample of 497 healthy adult volunteers before and after the vision of 2D and 3D movies. Viewers reporting some sickness (SSQ total score>15) were 54.8% of the total sample after the 3D movie compared to 14.1% of total sample after the 2D movie. Symptom intensity was 8.8 times higher than baseline after exposure to 3D movie (compared to the increase of 2 times the baseline after the 2D movie). Multivariate modeling of visually induced motion sickness as response variables pointed out the significant effects of exposure to 3D movie, history of car sickness and headache, after adjusting for gender, age, self reported anxiety level, attention to the movie and show time. CONCLUSIONS: Seeing 3D movies can increase rating of symptoms of nausea, oculomotor and disorientation, especially in women with susceptible visual-vestibular system. Confirmatory studies which include examination of clinical signs on viewers are needed to pursue a conclusive evidence on the 3D vision effects on spectators.","['Solimini, Angelo G']",['Solimini AG'],"['Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy. angelo.solimini@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,,2013/02/19 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/02/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056160 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-11154 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56160. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056160.

METHODS: A total 77 subjects who more than 9 years of age were enrolled in this study. We divided them into three groups; Thirty-four patients with exodeviation (Exo group), 11 patients with esodeviation (Eso group) and 32 volunteers with normal binocular vision (control group). The S3D images were shown to all patients with S3D high-definition TV for a period of 20 min. Best corrected visual acuity, refractive errors, angle of strabismus, stereopsis test and history of strabismus surgery, were evaluated. After watching S3D TV for 20 min, a survey of subjective symptoms was conducted with a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of S3D perception and asthenopic symptoms such as headache, dizziness and ocular fatigue while watching 3D TV. RESULTS: The mean amounts of deviation in the Exo group and Eso group were 11.2 PD and 7.73PD, respectively. Mean stereoacuity was 102.7 arc sec in the the Exo group and 1389.1 arc sec in the Eso group. In the control group, it was 41.9 arc sec. Twenty-nine patients in the Exo group showed excellent stereopsis (</=60 arc sec at near), but all 11 subjects of the Eso group showed 140 arc sec or worse and showed more decreased 3D perception than the Exo and the control group (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). The Exo group reported more eye fatigue (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) than the Eso and the control group. However, the scores of ocular fatigue in the patients who had undergone corrective surgery were less than in the patients who had not in the Exo group (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) and the amount of exodeviation was not correlated with the asthenopic symptoms (dizziness, r = 0.034, p = 0.33; headache, r = 0.320, p = 0.119; eye fatigue, r = 0.135, p = 0.519, Spearman rank correlation test, respectively). CONCLUSION: Symptoms of 3D asthenopia were related to the presence of exodeviation but not to esodeviation. This may indicate that S3D symptoms are closely related to the convergence demand.","['Kim, Seung-Hyun', 'Suh, Young-Woo', 'Yun, Cheol-Min', 'Yoo, Eun-Joo', 'Yeom, Ji-Hyun', 'Cho, Yoonae A']","['Kim SH', 'Suh YW', 'Yun CM', 'Yoo EJ', 'Yeom JH', 'Cho YA']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. ansaneye@hanmail.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Curr Eye Res,Current eye research,8104312,IM,,,,2013/02/15 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/02/15 06:00'],"['2013/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/02713683.2013.767352 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Eye Res. 2013 May;38(5):614-9. doi: 10.3109/02713683.2013.767352.

METHODS: A total of 180 rabbits were subjected to three tests, namely the skin microcirculation, the microvascular regeneration in the skin and the skin temperature change, with 60 rabbits for each test. The rabbits in each test were randomly and equally divided into three groups: the normal control group was treated with physiological saline on naked back once per day, the low dose group was treated with the eye-patch on naked back for 15 min once per day, while the high dose group was treated for three times per day. Forty Hartley guinea pigs were randomly and equally divided into four groups for the muscle tone test: the normal control group was treated with physiological saline on naked back, the model group was treated without any medication, the low dose group was treated with the eye-patch on naked back for 10 min once per day, while the high dose group was treated for three times per day. All treatments were continued for 14 days until the termination of the test. The microcirculatory blood flow was observed by using a video-microscopy system. The histological sections were used to detect the microvascular regeneration by observing the expression of factor VIII. The temperature changes on the skin surface were measured by using infrared thermometer, and the muscle tone was tested by the electromyography. RESULTS: In compare with the normal or the model group, the improvement in the skin microcirculation and the blood vascular regeneration, and the decreasing in the muscle tone in low dose and high dose groups were statistically significant with confident level at P<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The eye-patch with invigorating blood circulation and detoxification has great enhancement in blood vascular regeneration and skin microcirculation, and great improvement in the indexes for muscle tone. The study explains certain therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of the eye-patch and shows that it could reduce the symptoms for patients with asthenopia.","['Xiong, Ying', 'Wan, Xiu-Hua', 'Li, Jing', 'Li, Shi-Ming', 'Zhen, Yi']","['Xiong Y', 'Wan XH', 'Li J', 'Li SM', 'Zhen Y']","['Beijing Ophthalmology and Visual Science Key Laboratory, Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. bear0629@163.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,IM,,,,2013/02/02 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11655-012-1217-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2013 Feb;19(2):127-31. doi: 10.1007/s11655-012-1217-5.

A higher variance in fixation disparity is indicative of more visual fatigue. This observation is based on the results from a study where we investigated how fixation disparity was affected by glare on a VDU. Participants. In total 16 subjects with normal vision participated in this study. METHOD: In a balanced repeated-measurement experiment, all subjects performed equal near-vision tasks. In addition to the condition of no glare three controlled conditions of glare were used: direct light, indirect light, and desk luminary. After each condition, the fixation disparity was measured 15 times using a computerized fixation disparity test. RESULTS: The results showed that the average (mean) disparity was found to increase towards esophoric (crossed) with the adversity of the lighting conditions, but the differences were not significant. However, when analyzing the variation (standard deviation) within the 15 measurements and comparing these between conditions, we found that the direct light condition resulted in significantly higher variation compared to lighting condition of no glare and desk luminary lighting. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we argue that fixation disparity variance may be a useful objective measure of visual fatigue.","['Glimne, S', 'Seimyr, G Oqvist', 'Ygge, J', 'Nylen, P', 'Brautaset, R L']","['Glimne S', 'Seimyr GO', 'Ygge J', 'Nylen P', 'Brautaset RL']","['Unit of Optometry, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. susanne.glimne@ki.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,,,,2013/01/18 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/01/18 06:00'],"['2013/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['D36134MM55V5G841 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-121575 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2013;45(4):431-7. doi: 10.3233/WOR-121575.,,,20140505,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Computer Terminals', 'Female', '*Fixation, Ocular', 'Glare/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lighting', 'Male', 'Psychophysics', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this prospective single-centre clinical trial, 40 eyes of 20 patients with DED were recruited and randomly divided into two groups (group with MCAD exposure and group without MCAD). All subjects are visual display terminals (VDTs) workers spending at least 4 h/day in front of VDTs. Patients using MCAD underwent moist air applications for 4 h/day for a total of five working weekdays during VDT works at their offices. The other group of patients performed their VDT work without moist cool air device exposure. The change in symptoms of ocular surface (OS) dryness, fatigue and discomfort was evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Changes in visual function, tear functions and ocular surface status were evaluated using best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the functional visual acuity (FVA) test, blink rate, BUT measurements, strip meniscometry (SM), tear evaporation rate, fluorescein staining and rose bengal staining scores. Tear film lipid layer interferometry was also performed to assess the status of the lipid layer over the tear film. In addition, adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: In group with MCAD, symptoms of OS dryness during VDTs work, and FVA and BUT were significantly improved. SM and tear evaporation rate were significantly improved. There were no statistically significant differences on lipid layer stability and corneal staining scores in both groups. Blink rate was significantly increased in group without MCAD. No adverse events were reported during this trial. CONCLUSION: Moist cool air device use provided symptomatic relief of ocular dryness and improvement on tear stability in office workers with DED. This new device seems to be a safe and promising alternative in the treatment of DED.","['Hirayama, Masatoshi', 'Murat, Dogru', 'Liu, Ying', 'Kojima, Takashi', 'Kawakita, Tetsuya', 'Tsubota, Kazuo']","['Hirayama M', 'Murat D', 'Liu Y', 'Kojima T', 'Kawakita T', 'Tsubota K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, JapanMinami-Aoyama Eye Clinic, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Acta Ophthalmol,Acta ophthalmologica,101468102,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['dry eye', 'new moist air device', 'office worker', 'visual terminal displays']",,2013/01/03 06:00,2014/05/27 06:00,['2013/01/03 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1755-3768.2012.02485.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol. 2013 Dec;91(8):756-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1755-3768.2012.02485.x.

The process includes fixing of upper part with the sole of the footwear. The adhesives contain a mix of organic solvents, which are released in the working environment and cause irritation and lacrimation of eyes. In addition poor illumination and ventilation further aggravates the eyestrain. The present study was carried out to find out the prevalence and the associated factors of eyestrain in working children of footwear making units. The study included 139 exposed and 160 comparison group subjects. Self-reported eyestrain was recorded through personal interview. The prevalence of eyestrain in child laborers was 25.9%, which was significantly more than the 12.4% prevalence in comparison group subjects (P=0.01). Working children of footwear making units were at 2.4 times higher risk of developing eyestrain as compared to comparison group subjects, though statistically non significant. Significantly higher proportion of eyestrain was reported in those aged >12 years, males and those working daily for >4 hours. The higher prevalence of eyestrain in the working children of footwear units may be attributed to exposure to workplace factors.","['Tiwari, Rajnarayan R']",['Tiwari RR'],"['National Institute of Occupational Health, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. rajtiwari2810@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian Pediatr,Indian pediatrics,2985062R,IM,,,,2012/12/21 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/12/21 06:00'],"['2012/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S097475591200059 [pii]', '10.1007/s13312-013-0117-x [doi]']",ppublish,Indian Pediatr. 2013 Apr;50(4):411-3. doi: 10.1007/s13312-013-0117-x.

METHODS: Accommodative dynamics for a 2-diopter (D) step (2.5 <--> 4.5 D) stimulus were assessed using the WAM-5500 open-field autorefractor in 10 visually normal, asymptomatic, young-adult subjects before and after C and NC tasks performed on different days in a counterbalanced manner. For the C task, subjects altered binocular fixation (50 cycles) between reduced Snellen charts at 50 and 20 cm every 3 seconds to the beat of a metronome. For the NC task, subjects performed 50 cycles of accommodative flipper (+/- 1.5 D) as rapidly as possible while binocularly fixating on a reduced Snellen chart at 40 cm. RESULTS: Mean steady-state (SS) response level reflecting its accuracy was significantly (p </= 0.05) reduced post-NC task for both increasing (4.5-D level) and decreasing (2.5-D) accommodation. Although the SS response variability was significantly (p </= 0.05) increased post-NC task at the 4.5-D stimulus level, it did not change significantly (p > 0.05) for the C task. There were no significant differences between the pretask and posttask group mean initial amplitude, time constant, and peak velocity for either the C or the NC task for both increasing and decreasing accommodation. CONCLUSIONS: The accommodative system exhibited consistent fatigue effects with respect to SS variability and response accuracy. There was no objective evidence of oculomotor learning for these specific tasks.","['Thiagarajan, Preethi', 'Ciuffreda, Kenneth J']","['Thiagarajan P', 'Ciuffreda KJ']","['Department of Biological and Vision Sciences, SUNY State College of Optometry, New York, New York 10036, USA. pthiagarajan@sunyopt.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2012/12/13 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/12/13 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0b013e31827a233e [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2013 Jan;90(1):57-65. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e31827a233e.,,,20130611,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myopia/*physiopathology', '*Refraction, Ocular', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology', '*Visual Acuity', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of participants was 16 (8 persons aged 21-31, and 8 persons aged 50-70) for each display size. In all, 48 participants viewed 3 display sizes. In our physiological evaluation, CFF (critical flicker fusion frequency), blink rate and a sympathetic nerve activity index were used; and in the psychological evaluation, questionnaires and interviews were employed. Our results, based on physiological and psychological measurements, suggest the opti- mum viewing distance to be around 165-220 cm, irrespective of screen size.

We measured and compared visual fatigue and visual discomfort induced by viewing two different stereoscopic displays that either used the pattern retarder-spatial domain technology with linearly polarized three-dimensional technology or the circularly polarized three-dimensional technology using shutter glasses. METHODS: During this observational cross-over study performed at two subsequent days, a video was watched by 30 subjects (age: 20-30 years). Half of the participants watched the screen with a pattern retard three-dimensional display at the first day and a shutter glasses three-dimensional display at the second day, and reverse. The study participants underwent a standardized interview on visual discomfort and fatigue, and a series of functional examinations prior to, and shortly after viewing the movie. Additionally, a subjective score for visual fatigue was given. RESULTS: Accommodative magnitude (right eye: p < 0.001; left eye: p = 0.01), accommodative facility (p = 0.008), near-point convergence break-up point (p = 0.007), near-point convergence recover point (p = 0.001), negative (p = 0.03) and positive (p = 0.001) relative accommodation were significantly smaller, and the visual fatigue score was significantly higher (1.65 +/- 1.18 versus 1.20 +/- 1.03; p = 0.02) after viewing the shutter glasses three-dimensional display than after viewing the pattern retard three-dimensional display. CONCLUSIONS: Stereoscopic viewing using pattern retard (polarized) three-dimensional displays as compared with stereoscopic viewing using shutter glasses three-dimensional displays resulted in significantly less visual fatigue as assessed subjectively, parallel to significantly better values of accommodation and convergence as measured objectively.","['Zhang, Li', 'Zhang, Ya-Qin', 'Zhang, Jing-Shang', 'Xu, Liang', 'Jonas, Jost B']","['Zhang L', 'Zhang YQ', 'Zhang JS', 'Xu L', 'Jonas JB']","['Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital University of Medical Science, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Ophthalmol,Acta ophthalmologica,101468102,IM,,,,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/07/25 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/aos.12006 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol. 2013 Mar;91(2):e149-53. doi: 10.1111/aos.12006.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out using a paper based, self administered questionnaire. The questionnaire includes individual and movie characteristics and selected visually induced symptoms (tired eyes, double vision, headache, dizziness, nausea and palpitations). Symptoms were queried at 3 different times: during, right after and after 2 hours from the movie. RESULTS: We collected 953 questionnaires. In our sample, 539 (60.4%) individuals reported 1 or more symptoms during the movie, 392 (43.2%) right after and 139 (15.3%) at 2 hours from the movie. The most frequently reported symptoms were tired eyes (during the movie by 34.8%, right after by 24.0%, after 2 hours by 5.7% of individuals) and headache (during the movie by 13.7%, right after by 16.8%, after 2 hours by 8.3% of individuals). Individual history for frequent headache was associated with tired eyes (OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.01-1.79), double vision (OR = 1.96; 95%CI = 1.13-3.41), headache (OR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.41-3.10) during the movie and of headache after the movie (OR = 1.64; 95%CI = 1.16-2.32). Individual susceptibility to car sickness, dizziness, anxiety level, movie show time, animation 3D movie were also associated to several other symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The high occurrence of visually induced symptoms resulting from this survey suggests the need of raising public awareness on possible discomfort that susceptible individuals may suffer during and after the vision of 3D movies.","['Solimini, Angelo G', 'Mannocci, Alice', 'Di Thiene, Domitilla', 'La Torre, Giuseppe']","['Solimini AG', 'Mannocci A', 'Di Thiene D', 'La Torre G']","['Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Piazza Aldo Moro, 5, 00185, Rome, Italy. angelo.solimini@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,IM,,,,2012/09/15 06:00,2013/05/07 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2458-12-779 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2458-12-779 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2012 Sep 13;12:779. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-12-779.,,20120913,20130506,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/etiology', 'Asthenopia/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depth Perception', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Female', 'Headache/etiology', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*adverse effects', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Motion Pictures', 'Motion Sickness/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Nausea/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",PMC3490878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty adult subjects without ophthalmological abnormality watched the same 3D displays for 30 min. Each subject's near point of accommodation (NPA) and convergence (NPC), amplitude of fusional convergence and divergence, stereopsis, tear break-up time and temperature of ocular surface, and angle of phoric deviation were measured before and after viewing the 3D displays. In addition, a survey for subjective symptoms was conducted immediately following the viewing of the 3D displays. The above mentioned experiments were performed equally with two-dimensional (2D) displays in the same 30 subjects for detection of innate influence of 3D displays. RESULTS: The NPA and NPC in the subjects were significantly altered after watching the 3D displays (p<0.05) as compared with 2D displays. In addition, all of the 10 subjective symptoms measured were significantly increased after watching 3D displays (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Accommodation and binocular vergence are predominant ophthalmological factors that may influence asthenopia significantly following the viewing of 3D displays.

The Internet survey covered a range of indoor environment and ergonomics issues. Results show that working in these buildings were a generally positive experience for their health, performance and satisfaction. However, in one building there were persistent issues of variability in air temperature, air freshness, air quality and noise that affected the perceived health and performance of the occupants. Although the buildings were energy-efficient and sustainable structures, ergonomics design issues were identified. Implications for the role of ergonomics in green buildings and in the US LEED rating system are discussed. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: This survey identified a number of ergonomics design issues present in the LEED Platinum energy-efficient and sustainable buildings that were studied. These results highlight the importance of integrating ergonomics design into green buildings as a component in the US LEED rating system.","['Hedge, A', 'Dorsey, J A']","['Hedge A', 'Dorsey JA']","['Department of Design and Environmental Analysis, College of Human Ecology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. ah29@cornell.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,,,,2012/09/01 06:00,2014/01/28 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/00140139.2012.718367 [doi]'],ppublish,Ergonomics. 2013;56(3):492-506. doi: 10.1080/00140139.2012.718367.

A comprehensive visual and oculomotor function evaluation was performed on 40 U.S. military personnel, 20 with blast-induced mTBI and 20 without. In addition, a comprehensive symptom questionnaire was used to assess the frequency of visual, vestibular, and neuropsychiatric-associated symptoms. The most common mTBI-induced visual dysfunctions were associated with near oculomotor deficits, particularly large exophoria, decreased fusion ranges, receded near point of convergence, defective pursuit and saccadic eye movements, decreased amplitude of accommodation, and monocular accommodative facility. These were associated with reduced reading speed and comprehension and an increased Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey score. Photosensitivity was a common visual dysfunction along with hearing, balance, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The oculomotor testing for warfighters suspected of blast-induced mTBI should include, at a minimum, the assessment of near lateral and vertical phorias, positive fusional vergence, stereoacuity, near point of convergence, amplitude of accommodation, monocular accommodative facility, saccades, and pursuit eye movements. A reading test should be included in all routine exams as a functional assessment of the integration of oculomotor functions.","['Capo-Aponte, Jose E', 'Urosevich, Thomas G', 'Temme, Leonard A', 'Tarbett, Aaron K', 'Sanghera, Navjit K']","['Capo-Aponte JE', 'Urosevich TG', 'Temme LA', 'Tarbett AK', 'Sanghera NK']","['Visual Sciences Branch, Sensory Research Division, U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory, 6901 Andrews Avenue, Fort Rucker, AL 36330, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,IM,,,,2012/07/20 06:00,2012/10/05 06:00,['2012/07/20 06:00'],"['2012/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7205/milmed-d-12-00061 [doi]'],ppublish,Mil Med. 2012 Jul;177(7):804-13. doi: 10.7205/milmed-d-12-00061.,,,20121004,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', 'Blast Injuries/*complications', 'Brain Concussion/*complications/etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Comprehension', 'Female', 'Hearing Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Military Personnel', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Photophobia/etiology', 'Postural Balance', 'Reading', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vision Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to adapt font size may also open new reading opportunities for people with impaired or low vision. Based on their display technology two major groups of reading devices can be distinguished. One type, predominantly found in dedicated e-book readers, uses electronic paper also known as e-Ink. Other devices, mostly multifunction tablet-PCs, are equipped with backlit LCD displays. While it has long been accepted that reading on electronic displays is slow and associated with visual fatigue, this new generation is explicitly promoted for reading. Since research has shown that, compared to reading on electronic displays, reading on paper is faster and requires fewer fixations per line, one would expect differential effects when comparing reading behaviour on e-Ink and LCD. In the present study we therefore compared experimentally how these two display types are suited for reading over an extended period of time. METHODS: Participants read for several hours on either e-Ink or LCD, and different measures of reading behaviour and visual strain were regularly recorded. These dependent measures included subjective (visual) fatigue, a letter search task, reading speed, oculomotor behaviour and the pupillary light reflex. RESULTS: Results suggested that reading on the two display types is very similar in terms of both subjective and objective measures. CONCLUSIONS: It is not the technology itself, but rather the image quality that seems crucial for reading. Compared to the visual display units used in the previous few decades, these more recent electronic displays allow for good and comfortable reading, even for extended periods of time.","['Siegenthaler, Eva', 'Bochud, Yves', 'Bergamin, Per', 'Wurtz, Pascal']","['Siegenthaler E', 'Bochud Y', 'Bergamin P', 'Wurtz P']","['Institute for Research in Open-, Distance- and eLearning, Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences, Brig, Switzerland. eva.siegenthaler@ffhs.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2012/07/06 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/07/06 06:00'],"['2012/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1475-1313.2012.00928.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2012 Sep;32(5):367-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2012.00928.x.

METHODS: One hundred and two cases (204 eyes) were divided into a low exposure group and a high exposure group, fifty-one cases in each group. The same intervention of acupoints massage on Cuanzhu (BL 2), Jingming (BL 1), Sizhukong (TE 23), Sibai (ST 2) and Taiyang(EX-HN 5) were given to the two groups, one acupoint for 5 min and once everyday, one month of which made a course. The symptom score, tear film break-up time (BUT) and Schirmer I test(SIT) were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: (1) The correlation coefficient of cubic curve model of the exposure dose was the biggest with symptom improvement index (P = 0.000), which indicated that the lower VDT exposure index was, the more obvious the symptom improved. The symptom improvement indices of low exposure group and high exposure group, which were (52.31 +/- 16.65)% and (28.93 +/- 13.35)% respectively, were statistical significant difference (P = 0.000). (2) Compared to before treatment, the levels of BUT and SIT in the two groups were both significantly higher (P < 0.05). Compared with the high exposure group, the levels of BUT and SIT in the low exposure group were increased by 0.826 s (P = 0.022) and 1.029 mm (P = 0.033), respectively, after the impact of BUT and SIT was corrected before the research. CONCLUSION: The acupoints massage can improve the symptoms and ocular physiology for patients with VDT asthenpia, and it is more effective for the low exposure cases.","['Xu, Yan', 'Gu, Guang-Xia', 'Yang, Xiao-Sheng', 'Pan, Chun-Ying', 'Hou, Wen-Li', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Xing, Qin']","['Xu Y', 'Gu GX', 'Yang XS', 'Pan CY', 'Hou WL', 'Zhao W', 'Xing Q']","['The Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Luoyang City, Henan Province, China.']",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Zhen Jiu,Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion,8600658,IM,,,,2012/06/28 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2012 Apr;32(4):351-3.,,,20120717,,,"['*Acupuncture Points', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Computer Terminals/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Massage', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Tears/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examine the relationship between eyestrain, color preferences, and function of the accommodation and vergence system. Specifically, we examine whether symptomatic observers select colors that reduce accommodative demand based on longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA). METHODS: Forty-seven undergraduate students participated in this study. Visual discomfort symptoms were assessed using the Conlon survey. A Mark 2 Intuitive Colorimeter was used to obtain optimal colored light preferences. LCA was modeled using the Chromatic Eye and spectral power density data. A comprehensive evaluation of accommodation and vergence was performed following standard procedures. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation (r = -0.51) was found between eyestrain symptoms and the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) v' axis of colors preferences. Additionally, a significant negative correlation (r = -0.31) was found between eyestrain symptoms and LCA accommodation. Two thirds of the participants in the high discomfort group chose colors that decreased accommodative demand. Accommodative amplitude and vergence facility also correlated with LCA, accounting for 25% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: The color preferences of individuals are systematically influenced by the functioning of their accommodation and vergence systems with increased symptomatology resulting in color selections that reduce LCA accommodative stimulus demand.","['Drew, Stefanie A', 'Borsting, Eric', 'Stark, Lawrence R', 'Chase, Chris']","['Drew SA', 'Borsting E', 'Stark LR', 'Chase C']","['College of Optometry, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California 91766, USA. sdrew@westernu.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2012/06/27 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/OPX.0b013e31825da2f7 [doi]', '00006324-201207000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2012 Jul;89(7):E1059-67. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e31825da2f7.,,,20121204,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', '*Color Perception', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",,['R15EY015922/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study measured prevalence and magnitude of perceived immersion and viewing symptoms in stereoscopic viewing, and related them to viewer's characteristics and viewing position. METHODS: Two hundred three teens and adults viewed a movie in 2D or 3D while sitting at different angles and distances. Their prior viewing symptoms, as well as visual and physical discomfort immediately before and after viewing, were measured with questionnaires. They were also asked to report their perceived immersion after the viewing. RESULTS: Twelve percent and twenty-one percent of 2D and stereoscopic 3D participants reported increases of measured symptoms during and/or after viewing. Stereoscopic 3D viewing incurred greater and more frequent perception of blurred vision, double vision, dizziness, disorientation, and nausea than 2D viewing. Reported ocular and physical symptoms were negatively correlated to perceived immersion in 3D viewing. Older viewers (age 46 years or older) reported greater ocular, visual, and motion sickness symptoms in 2D viewing, and younger viewers (age 24-34 years) reported greater visual and motion sickness symptoms in 3D viewing. Sitting in an oblique position attenuated perceived immersion but also reduced motion symptoms in 3D viewing. Prior viewing symptoms in 2D tasks also predicted ocular and physical symptoms in 2D but less so in 3D viewing. CONCLUSIONS: Stereoscopic 3D viewing provides greater immersion, but it can also lead to heightened visual and motion sickness symptoms. Viewers with prior symptoms in viewing TV and computer screen are not more likely to have increased ocular and physical symptoms in 3D viewing. Young viewers incurred higher immersion but also greater visual and motion sickness symptoms in 3D viewing; both will be reduced if a farther distance and a wider viewing angle are adopted.","['Yang, Shun-nan', 'Schlieski, Tawny', 'Selmins, Brent', 'Cooper, Scott C', 'Doherty, Rina A', 'Corriveau, Philip J', 'Sheedy, James E']","['Yang SN', 'Schlieski T', 'Selmins B', 'Cooper SC', 'Doherty RA', 'Corriveau PJ', 'Sheedy JE']","['Vision Performance Institute, Pacific University College of Optometry, Forest Grove, Oregon 97006, USA. shunnan.yang@pacificu.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2012/06/27 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/OPX.0b013e31825da430 [doi]', '00006324-201207000-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2012 Jul;89(7):1068-80. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e31825da430.,,,20121204,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging/pathology', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Depth Perception/*physiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Vision, Binocular', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings of eye strain, tired eyes, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, blurred vision and double vision, when appearing together, have recently been termed 'computer vision syndrome', or asthenopia. To examine the frequency and intensity of asthenopia among individuals employed in research and development departments of high-tech firms and the effects of job stress and burnout on ocular complaints, this study included 106 subjects, 42 high-tech workers (study group) and 64 bank employees (control group). All participants completed self-report questionnaires covering demographics, asthenopia, satisfaction with work environmental conditions, job-related stress and burnout. There was a significant between-group difference in the intensity of asthenopia, but not in its frequency. Burnout appeared to be a significant contributing factor to the intensity and frequency of asthenopia. This study shows that burnout is a significant factor in asthenopic complaints in high-tech workers. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: This manuscript analyses the effects of psychological environmental factors, such as job stress and burnout, on ocular complaints at the workplace of computer users. The findings may have an ergonomic impact on how to improve health, safety and comfort of the working environment among computer users, for better perception of the job environment, efficacy and production.","['Ostrovsky, Anat', 'Ribak, Joseph', 'Pereg, Avihu', 'Gaton, Dan']","['Ostrovsky A', 'Ribak J', 'Pereg A', 'Gaton D']","['Department of Environmental & Occupational Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. anatostr@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,,,,2012/06/09 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/00140139.2012.681808 [doi]'],ppublish,Ergonomics. 2012;55(8):854-62. doi: 10.1080/00140139.2012.681808.

The latter may be related to elevated tension in the orbicularis oculi muscle and development of muscle pain. The aim of the study was to investigate the development of discomfort symptoms in relation to muscle activity and muscle blood flow in the orbicularis oculi muscle during computer work with visual strain. METHODS: A group of healthy young adults with normal vision was randomly selected. Eye-related symptoms were recorded during a 2-h working session on a laptop. The participants were exposed to visual stressors such as glare and small font. Muscle load and blood flow were measured by electromyography and photoplethysmography, respectively. RESULTS: During 2 h of visually demanding computer work, there was a significant increase in the following symptoms: eye-related pain and tiredness, blurred vision, itchiness, gritty eyes, photophobia, dry eyes, and tearing eyes. Muscle load in orbicularis oculi was significantly increased above baseline and stable at 1 to 1.5% maximal voluntary contraction during the working sessions. Orbicularis oculi muscle blood flow increased significantly during the first part of the working sessions before returning to baseline. There were significant positive correlations between eye-related tiredness and orbicularis oculi muscle load and eye-related pain and muscle blood flow. Subjects who developed eye-related pain showed elevated orbicularis oculi muscle blood flow during computer work, but no differences in muscle load, compared with subjects with minimal pain symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Eyestrain during visually demanding computer work is related to the orbicularis oculi muscle. Muscle pain development during demanding, low-force exercise is associated with increased muscle blood flow, possible secondary to different muscle activity pattern, and/or increased mental stress level in subjects experiencing pain compared with subjects with minimal pain.","['Thorud, Hanne-Mari Schiotz', 'Helland, Magne', 'Aaras, Arne', 'Kvikstad, Tor Martin', 'Lindberg, Lars Goran', 'Horgen, Gunnar']","['Thorud HM', 'Helland M', 'Aaras A', 'Kvikstad TM', 'Lindberg LG', 'Horgen G']","['Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Buskerud University College, Kongsberg, Norway. hannemt@hibu.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2012/03/01 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/02/28 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0b013e31824c1801 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2012 Apr;89(4):E452-64. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e31824c1801.,,,20120814,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Attitude to Computers', '*Computers', 'Electromyography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/blood supply/*physiopathology', 'Oculomotor Muscles/blood supply/*physiopathology', 'Pain/diagnosis/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Pain Measurement', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Reference Values', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated ophthalmic factors associated with 3D asthenopia. METHODS: One hundred fifteen volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, were enrolled in this study. 3D images were shown to all volunteers with 3D high-definition television for 90 minutes. Subjects who felt eyestrain were assigned to the asthenopia group (14 subjects) and subjects without symptoms were assigned to the control group (22 subjects). Ophthalmic factors including visual acuity, refractive errors, interpupillary distance, intraocular pressure, tear break-up time, near point of accommodation, presence of strabismus, stereoacuity, and retinal abnormalities were evaluated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Six subjects in the asthenopia group had exophoria and 1 subject in the control group had constant exotropia. None of these participants had previously noticed symptoms of strabismus. Only the presence of strabismus was significantly different between the groups (P = .008). CONCLUSION: The presence of exophoria may be a risk factor for 3D asthenopia, and 3D television may induce asthenopia by exacerbating this latent problem.","['Kim, Seung-Hyun', 'Suh, Young-Woo', 'Song, Jong-Suk', 'Park, Ji-Hye', 'Kim, Yong Yeon', 'Huh, Kuhl', 'Son, Jaebum', 'Kham, Keetaek', 'Jeong, Taeuk', 'Pyo, Kyung Soo']","['Kim SH', 'Suh YW', 'Song JS', 'Park JH', 'Kim YY', 'Huh K', 'Son J', 'Kham K', 'Jeong T', 'Pyo KS']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Korea University Ansan Hospital, 516, Gojan-dong, Gyunggi-do, 425-707, Republic of Korea. ansaneye@hanmail.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus,Journal of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus,7901143,IM,,,,2012/02/15 06:00,2013/09/13 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/01913913-20120207-03 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2012 Jul-Aug;49(4):248-53. doi: 10.3928/01913913-20120207-03.

It is determined the existence of differences in visibility of alphanumeric presentations when screen filters are used, compared to conditions when they are not used. This difference was statistically significant, while the visibility of the presented alphanumeric symbols on CRT and LCD screens that use screen filters is lower than when they are not used.

Studies with cross sectional and intervention design indicate an association between the two symptom categories. Still, whether visually demanding near work, per se, contributes to increased neck/shoulder discomfort remains a question of debate. The aim of this laboratory study was to assess if visually demanding experimental near work affects eye- and neck/shoulder-discomfort when the posture was adjusted for comfort and no movements were allowed. Thirty-three healthy subjects performed a visually demanding computer screen task (viewing task) under four different optical lens conditions: binocular -3.5 D and monocular -3.5 D, +3.5 D and +/- 0 D. During the experiment subjects were seated in an office chair (with neck support) that was individually adjusted for comfort. At baseline and after each viewing task, subjects reported their perceived eye- and neck/shoulder discomfort on Borg's CR-10 scale. Results show a significant increase of eye discomfort between baseline and the first viewing task, and a significant increase in neck/shoulder discomfort from baseline throughout the first three viewing tasks. Further analysis is required to determent whether the neck/shoulder discomfort was induced by the demanding near work or the static posture, or a combination.","['Lodin, Camilla', 'Forsman, Mikael', 'Richter, Hans']","['Lodin C', 'Forsman M', 'Richter H']","['Center for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Occupational and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Occupational Studies, University of Gavle, SE-801 76 Gavle, Sweden. camilla.lodin.@hig.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,,,,2012/02/10 06:00,2014/02/20 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['289U158XK556H5U8 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-2012-0613-3388 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2012;41 Suppl 1:3388-92. doi: 10.3233/WOR-2012-0613-3388.,,,20140219,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology', 'Computer Terminals', 'Ergonomics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neck Pain/*etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Posture', 'Shoulder Pain/*etiology', 'Work', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of an ergonomics consultant is to provide integrated solutions to improve comfort, safety and productivity. In Australia, there are two types of consultants--generalists and specialists. Both have training in ergonomics but specialist knowledge may be the result of previous education or work experience. This paper presents three projects illustrating generalist and specialist (visual ergonomics) consultancy: development of a vision screening protocol, solving visual discomfort in an office environment and solving postural discomfort in heavy industry. These case studies demonstrate how multiple ergonomics consultants may work together to solve ergonomics problems. It also describes some of the challenges for consultants, for those engaging their services and for the ergonomics profession, e.g. recognizing the boundaries of expertise, sharing information with business competitors, the costs-benefits of engaging multiple consultants and the risk of fragmentation of ergonomics knowledge and solutions. Since ergonomics problems are often multifaceted, ergonomics consultants should have a solid grounding in all domains of ergonomics, even if they ultimately only practice in one specialty or domain. This will benefit the profession and ensure that ergonomics remains a holistic discipline.","['Long, Jennifer', 'Long, Airdrie']","['Long J', 'Long A']","['Jennifer Long Visual Ergonomics, PO Box 645 Katoomba, NSW 2780, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,,,,2012/02/10 06:00,2014/02/20 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['Y81087GH32764771 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-2012-0610-3372 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2012;41 Suppl 1:3372-8. doi: 10.3233/WOR-2012-0610-3372.,,,20140219,,,"['Asthenopia/prevention & control', 'Australia', '*Ergonomics', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Lighting', 'Posture', 'Problem Solving', '*Referral and Consultation', '*Specialization', 'Vision Screening']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fourteen female students were given the intervention with optical and binocular vergence demands for 1.5 min immediately after 20 min of a sustained task on a three-dimensional display. Before and after the trial, their ocular functions were measured and their symptoms assessed. A new type of intervention was developed that can vary optical and binocular vergence demands. For control, the subjects rested with eyes closed for 1.5 min after the task instead of the intervention. RESULTS: In the control group, accommodative contraction time (from far to near) and accommodative relaxation time (from near to far) was delayed from 1.13 to 1.68 s and from 1.36 to 1.60 s, respectively, and the symptom of asthenopia increased after rest. In the intervention group, however, changes in those functions were smaller than those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the new intervention with optical and binocular vergence demands is effective for the treatment of accommodative insufficiency that follows sustained periods of visual task, and consequently, the symptom of asthenopia induced by accommodative insufficiency may decrease.","['Iwasaki, Tsuneto', 'Nagata, Tatsuo', 'Tawara, Akihiko']","['Iwasaki T', 'Nagata T', 'Tawara A']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health Japan, Kitakyushu, Japan. kabosu @ med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Ophthalmologica,Ophthalmologica.

DESIGN: Prospective case series; setting: university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 58 patients with severe visual field loss: 21 with glaucoma, 18 with retinitis pigmentosa, and 19 with postchiasmal visual pathway lesions. METHODS: Following initial testing with three isopters (I2e or V4e, I4e and III4e), presentations of the III4e stimulus were repeated four times during the same session along identical vectors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variability in III4e-isopter position (scatter of kinetic threshold) and the difference of isopter area between the first and four subsequent sessions (fatigue effect) of SKP were analyzed by diagnosis, age, visual acuity and reaction time (RT). RESULTS: The mean scatter of the kinetic threshold was 2.5 degrees (deg) in the glaucoma group, 1.5 deg in the group with retinitis pigmentosa, and 1.7 deg in the group of patients with postchiasmal lesions. The difference in the isopter area between a single examination and four times repeated examination was 656 square degrees (deg(2)) in the glaucoma group, 104 deg(2) in the retinitis pigmentosa group and 227 deg(2) in the group of patients with postchiasmal lesions. Post-hoc regression analysis revealed that the variability of isopter position increased as the RT increased. CONCLUSION: The variability of III4e-isopter positionand fatiguewere most pronounced among glaucoma patients. RT is the most important factor influencing the variability of responses and fatigue during SKP, thus we propose that it can be used as a reliability indicator of SKP.","['Nowomiejska, Katarzyna', 'Brzozowska, Agnieszka', 'Zarnowski, Tomasz', 'Rejdak, Robert', 'Weleber, Richard G', 'Schiefer, Ulrich']","['Nowomiejska K', 'Brzozowska A', 'Zarnowski T', 'Rejdak R', 'Weleber RG', 'Schiefer U']","['Centre of Ophthalmology, Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. katarzynanowomiejska@mailcity.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Ophthalmologica,Ophthalmologica.

In the Active group, eleven subjects ingested a supplement containing omega-3 fatty acid-rich fish oil (docosahexaenoic acid 783 mg/day, eicosapentaenoic acid 162 mg/day), bilberry extract (anthocyanidin 59 mg/day), and lutein (17.5 mg/day) in soft gel capsule form, every day for 4 weeks. In the Placebo group, nine subjects ingested placebo capsules. Before and after supplementation, subjects completed a questionnaire to determine their asthenopia symptoms and were also assessed for mental fatigue symptom by the visual analog scale (VAS) test. Asthenopia symptoms such as ""stiff shoulder, low back pain"", ""frustration"", ""dry-eye"", and ""stuffy head"" were improved in the Active group. Furthermore, a score of mental fatigue was improved after 4 weeks of supplementation, and no side effects were observed after the 4-week supplementation and a 2-week washout period in the Active group.

Ocular symptoms may include asthenopia, accommodative and vergence difficulties and dry eye. Previous studies have reported that uncorrected astigmatism may have a significant impact on symptoms of CVS. However, its effect on task performance is unclear. METHODS: This study recorded symptoms after a 10 min period of reading from a computer monitor either through the habitual distance refractive correction or with a supplementary -1.00 or -2.00D oblique cylinder added over these lenses in 12 young, visually-normal subjects. Additionally, the distance correction condition was repeated to assess the repeatability of the symptom questionnaire. Subjects' reading speed and accuracy were monitored during the course of the 10 min trial. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in reading rate or the number of errors between the three astigmatic conditions. However, a significant change in symptoms was reported with the median total symptom scores for the 0, 1 and 2D astigmatic conditions being 2.0, 6.5 and 40.0, respectively (p < 0.0001). Further, the repeatability coefficient of the total symptom score following the repeated zero astigmatism condition was +/- 13.46. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of induced astigmatism produced a significant increase in post-task symptoms but did not affect reading rate or the number of reading errors. The correction of small astigmatic refractive errors may be important in optimizing patient comfort during computer operation.","['Rosenfield, Mark', 'Hue, Jennifer E', 'Huang, Rae R', 'Bababekova, Yuliya']","['Rosenfield M', 'Hue JE', 'Huang RR', 'Bababekova Y']","['SUNY College of Optometry, New York, USA. mrosenfield@sunyopt.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2011/12/14 06:00,2012/04/18 06:00,['2011/12/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00887.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2012 Mar;32(2):142-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00887.x.

However, it is not known whether increased cognitive load contributes to asthenopic symptoms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of increased cognitive load (with or without visual stress inducing conditions) to asthenopic symptoms associated with prolonged near work. METHODS: Thirty-three visually normal subjects, aged 18 to 30 years, participated in the study. Subjects read texts or watched videos under different visual stress and cognitive loads. Visual stress conditions were good visual quality, low contrast, and induced refractive error. The cognitive load levels were watching video, reading fairy tales, and reading technical articles. As an additional task, subjects also listened to technical articles. At the end of each condition, subjects rated the magnitude of any asthenopic symptoms, visual discomfort, and cognitive discomfort they experienced during the task. Electromyography potentials recorded from the lower orbicularis oculi muscle were used to obtain blink rate. RESULTS: Subjects reported greater internal symptoms for the refractive error condition coupled with higher cognitive load compared to good visual and low contrast conditions (p < 0.01). For the low contrast condition coupled with higher cognitive load, greater external symptoms were reported compared to good visual and refractive error conditions (p < 0.05). However, asthenopic symptoms were not reported for cognitively demanding tasks when the visual condition was good. Blink rates were not significantly different between the good visual and low contrast conditions within each cognitive load level. For the cognitively difficult reading conditions, blink rate was significantly decreased for the low contrast and good visual conditions compared to the refractive error condition. CONCLUSIONS: An interaction between cognitive and visual demands was observed. Greater cognitive loads accentuate the same differentiated symptoms normally caused by visual stressors.","['Gowrisankaran, Sowjanya', 'Nahar, Niru K', 'Hayes, John R', 'Sheedy, James E']","['Gowrisankaran S', 'Nahar NK', 'Hayes JR', 'Sheedy JE']","['College of Optometry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. sowjanya@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0b013e318236dd88 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2012 Jan;89(1):97-104. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e318236dd88.,,,20120529,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Blinking/*physiology', 'Cognition/*physiology', 'Electromyography', 'Eyelids/*physiopathology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Photic Stimulation/adverse effects', 'Reading', 'Reference Values', 'Stress, Psychological/*complications/physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-five subjects, with 20/20 vision and without history of ocular pathology or cognitive deficits, participated in the study. Subjects read under different visual and cognitive difficulty levels for 6 (30-minute) conditions. Upper and lower orbicularis oculi, frontalis, and trapezius muscle activities were recorded using surface electromyography (EMG). Aperture size, pupil diameter, and pulse rate of the subjects were recorded with a video camera, pulse meter, and ISCAN eye tracker (ISCAN Inc.), respectively. RESULTS: The results show that the texts read with a refractive error caused increased orbicularis oculi EMG power and reduced aperture size (P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the conditions for pulse rate, pupil diameter, or EMG activity of the frontalis and trapezius muscles with either visual or cognitive stress presented in this experiment. CONCLUSION: Visual stress experienced due to reading under an induced refractive error is potentially mediated by a local mechanism, different from the mechanism underlying reading under low contrast or high cognitive demand.","['Nahar, Niru K', 'Gowrisankaran, Sowjanya', 'Hayes, John R', 'Sheedy, James E']","['Nahar NK', 'Gowrisankaran S', 'Hayes JR', 'Sheedy JE']","['The Ohio State University, College of Optometry, Columbus, USA.

In this method, the difference of the nearest distances to distinguish Landolt rings between before and after the usage of LCD monitors was used as the index of eyestrain. When the nearest distance for distinguishing Landolt rings increased, the eyestrain was considered to be severe. A total of 11 observers (2 physicians and 9 radiological technologists) participated to this observer study. In the observer study, the TG18-QC pattern, a standard clinical image of 400 images, and JESRA X-0093 were observed using color and monochromatic LCD monitors for approximately 30 minutes. In addition to the observer study, the noise power spectrum (NPS) of the color and the monochromatic monitors were measured using the NS2002 method. The ratio of the nearest distance after 30 minutes of reading and that of before reading was larger when the color LCD monitor was used than when the monochromatic LCD monitor was used (p<0.05), and thus, the monochromatic LCD monitor was considered to be superior to the color LCD monitor in terms of the degree of eyestrain during image readings. In conclusion, comparing the nearest point for distinguishing Landolt rings measured before and after readings can be used to evaluate eyestrain in diagnostic radiology.","['Okumura, Akiyoshi', 'Koike, Rumi', 'Onoda, Yui', 'Matsui, Takurou', 'Arai, Kazuo', 'Shimooka, Ryouji', 'Tsurutani, Hiroshi']","['Okumura A', 'Koike R', 'Onoda Y', 'Matsui T', 'Arai K', 'Shimooka R', 'Tsurutani H']","['Central Radiation Room, Tatebayashi Kousei Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi,7505722,IM,,,,2011/07/30 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/07/30 06:00'],"['2011/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jjrt/67.800 [pii]', '10.6009/jjrt.67.800 [doi]']",ppublish,Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai Zasshi. 2011;67(7):800-4. doi: 10.6009/jjrt.67.800.,,,20120201,,,"['Asthenopia/*diagnosis', 'Color', 'Computer Terminals', 'Data Display', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Humans', '*Liquid Crystals', 'Vision Tests', 'Visual Perception']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are numerous potential sources of adverse effects, but we focused on how vergence-accommodation conflicts in stereo displays affect visual discomfort and fatigue. In one experiment, we examined the effect of viewing distance on discomfort and fatigue. We found that conflicts of a given dioptric value were slightly less comfortable at far than at near distance. In a second experiment, we examined the effect of the sign of the vergence-accommodation conflict on discomfort and fatigue. We found that negative conflicts (stereo content behind the screen) are less comfortable at far distances and that positive conflicts (content in front of screen) are less comfortable at near distances. In a third experiment, we measured phoria and the zone of clear single binocular vision, which are clinical measurements commonly associated with correcting refractive error. Those measurements predicted susceptibility to discomfort in the first two experiments. We discuss the relevance of these findings for a wide variety of situations including the viewing of mobile devices, desktop displays, television, and cinema.","['Shibata, Takashi', 'Kim, Joohwan', 'Hoffman, David M', 'Banks, Martin S']","['Shibata T', 'Kim J', 'Hoffman DM', 'Banks MS']","['Vision Science Program, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Vis,Journal of vision,101147197,IM,,,,2011/07/23 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['11.8.11 [pii]', '10.1167/11.8.11 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis. 2011 Jul 21;11(8):11. doi: 10.1167/11.8.11.,,20110721,20121016,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Convergence, Ocular/*physiology', 'Depth Perception/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Reference Values', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3369815,"['R01 EY012851/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY12851/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS379037'],,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Office workers employed at large social services companies in two cities (Warszawa and Katowice) were invited to fill in a questionnaire (cross-sectional study). The questions included work history and history of last-week eye symptoms and eye-related complains. Altogether 477 men and women returned the completed questionnaires. Between-group symptom differences were tested by the chi-square test and verified by the results of multivariate logistic analysis. The examined effects included the role of daily computer use and lighting conditions at work stations. RESULTS: The examined persons complained of such eye symptoms as eye strain, visual acuity impairment and mucosal dryness or eye burning. The following values of symptom prevalence were found in women and men, respectively: eye strain 50.7% and 32.6%, disturbed visual acuity 38.3% and 21.2%, mucosal dryness and eye burning 46.5% and 24.2%. The results of multivariate analysis confirmed the statistically significant effects of lighting intensity and screen flickering on the occurrence of symptoms.

METHODS: The investigation with questionnaires was conducted in 2 246 undergraduates and postgraduates from four universities in Haidian District by multi-level stratified cluster sampling. Factor analysis and multivariate Logistic regression model were conducted to explore the related factors for visual fatigue. RESULTS: Among the university students, the total prevalence rate of visual fatigue was 64.9%, and the prevalence rates of males, females, undergraduates and postgraduates were 65.1%, 64.7%, 58.9% and 75.7%, respectively. The result of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that bad living environment conditions, improper computer use and bad health status were significantly associated with increased risk of visual fatigue, the ORs (95% CI) were 1.185 (1.078, 1.302), 1.490 (1.355, 1.640) and 1.323 (1.182, 1.481), respectively; good sleep and mental status, good psycho-social state, and good factors of habits and diets might be protective against visual fatigue, the ORs (95% CI) were 0.691 (0.628, 0.760), 0.793 (0.720, 0.873) and 0.649 (0.587, 0.717), respectively.

STUDY POPULATION: The participants consisted of 3,971 employees who worked with computers for a minimum of one hour a day. 2,551 (73%) were men and 945 (27%) women, with an age range of 18 up to 64 years. The mean age was 38.1 (SD=10.7) for men and 37.6 (SD=12.0) for the women. The measures were obtained via a self-administered survey in combination with a visual examination conducted by an optometrist. METHODS: Two complementary logistic regression analyses with forced entry was conducted on n=3,496 (88% adjusted response rate) cases. The effect of ocular symptoms on the risk of reporting musculoskeletal symptoms, or vice versa, was examined first in two separate binominal logistic regression analyses. Age, Gender, Near work variable and Visual functioning variables were included in these analyzes. Variables associated with the risk of developing an increase in either symptom category were also examined in two additional binomial logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Exposure to spectacles (single vision, multifocal, or progressive correction) in combination with a visual acuity <1 surfaced as a key mediator of symptoms from the neck/scapular area (p<0.01). A vergence disparity (uncompensated vergence error) similarly was associated with an augmented risk of developing an increase in neck/scapular area symptoms (p<0.05). The most influential risk factor for neck/scapular area symptoms were ocular symptoms and vice versa (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis which postulates that eye-neck/scapular area symptoms interaction may be due to a functional coupling from and between the eye-neck/scapular area muscles [28].","['Richter, Hans O', 'Zetterlund, Christina', 'Lundqvist, Lars-Olov']","['Richter HO', 'Zetterlund C', 'Lundqvist LO']","['Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Occupational and Public Health Science, Faculty of Health and Working Life, University of Gavle, Sweden. hrr@hig.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,,,,2011/06/16 06:00,2011/10/18 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['915G24151368Q7X5 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-2011-1152 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2011;39(1):67-78. doi: 10.3233/WOR-2011-1152.,['(c) 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

To better understand how much eye focus needs to be restored for presbyopic corrections to be adequate, this study investigated the robustness of the pre-presbyopic human accommodative system during a sustained and intensive near vision task. METHODS: Twenty-one pre-presbyopic volunteers (aged 26.1 +/- 4.7 years) participated in the study. Binocular subjective amplitude of accommodation was measured before and after a prolonged reading exercise, using the RAF rule. During the 30 min reading task, the subject's closest comfortable eye-to-text distance and pupil size was monitored. Accommodative accuracy to 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 D stimuli was determined objectively using a validated binocular open-view autorefractor immediately before, and after the reading task. RESULTS: Amplitude of accommodation (p=0.09) and accommodative accuracy (p>0.05) were statistically unchanged following the intensive near task. The mean proportion of accommodation exerted throughout the near exercise was 80.6% (range 45.3 +/- 3.7 to 96.6 +/- 4.3%), which increased as the task progressed (F=2.24, p=0.02). The mean percentage of accommodation utilised increased with subject age (r=0.517, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: The pre-presbyopic human accommodative system is robust to fatigue during intense and prolonged near work. A greater proportion of one's amplitude of accommodation may be continuously exerted than previously suggested.","['Wolffsohn, James S', 'Sheppard, Amy L', 'Vakani, Sanjay', 'Davies, Leon N']","['Wolffsohn JS', 'Sheppard AL', 'Vakani S', 'Davies LN']","['Aston University, School of Life and Health Sciences, Ophthalmic Research Group and Aston Research Centre for Health Ageing, Birmingham, UK. j.s.w.wolffsohn@aston.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/11/15 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00847.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2011 Sep;31(5):480-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00847.x.

Many clinicians view treating these patients, especially adults with childhood-onset exotropia, as challenging. Conflicting opinions still exist regarding prescribing any treatment for adult strabismics, including surgical realignment and optometric vision therapy (VT). CASE REPORTS: Two cases are discussed, both of which are adult patients with moderate-size intermittent exotropia of the basic type who presented with asthenopia, headaches, and/or diplopia. Twenty to 30 in-office VT sessions were recommended to reduce the magnitude and frequency of the deviation as well as improve their binocularity and decrease their symptoms. After completing VT, both patients became phoric for all distances, had normal vergence ability, and had normal near points of convergence. In the second case, the long-term outcome was evaluated 5 years post-therapy. CONCLUSION: Optometric VT was highly successful in both patients with childhood intermittent exotropia of the basic type. Most important, optometric VT eliminated the patients' symptoms of asthenopia and diplopia without the need for surgery.","['Peddle, Angela', 'Han, Esther', 'Steiner, Audra']","['Peddle A', 'Han E', 'Steiner A']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, State University of New York State College of Optometry, New York, New York, USA. dr.apeddle@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Optometry,"Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)",100912421,IM,,,,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1529-1839(11)00073-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.optm.2010.12.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Optometry. 2011 Aug;82(8):467-74. doi: 10.1016/j.optm.2010.12.013.

The relatively small screens found in these devices may necessitate close working distances and small text sizes, which can increase the demands placed on accommodation and vergence. METHODS: Font size and viewing distance were measured while subjects used handheld electronic devices in two separate trials. In the first study (n=129), subjects were asked to show a typical text message on their own personal phone and to hold the device ""as if they were about to read a text message."" A second trial was conducted in a similar manner except subjects (n=100) were asked to view a specific web page from the internet. RESULTS: For text messages and internet viewing, the mean font size was 1.1 M (range, 0.7 to 2.1 M) and 0.8 M (range, 0.3 to 1.4 M), respectively. The mean working distance for text messages and internet viewing was 36.2 cm (range, 17.5 to 58.0 cm) and 32.2 cm (range, 19 to 60 cm), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mean font size for both conditions was comparable with newspaper print, although some subjects viewed text that was considerably smaller. However, the mean working distances were closer than the typical near working distance of 40 cm for adults when viewing hardcopy text. These close distances place increased demands on both accommodation and vergence, which could exacerbate symptoms. Practitioners need to consider the closer distances adopted while viewing material on smart phones when examining patients and prescribing refractive corrections for use at near, as well as when treating patients presenting with asthenopia associated with nearwork.","['Bababekova, Yuliya', 'Rosenfield, Mark', 'Hue, Jennifer E', 'Huang, Rae R']","['Bababekova Y', 'Rosenfield M', 'Hue JE', 'Huang RR']","['State University of New York, SUNY State College of Optometry, New York, New York 10036, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182198792 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2011 Jul;88(7):795-7. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182198792.,['Copyright (c) 2011 American Academy of Optometry'],,20111109,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cell Phone', '*Computer Communication Networks', 'Convergence, Ocular', 'Female', '*Fixation, Ocular', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Male', 'Printing/*instrumentation', '*Reading', '*Size Perception', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In modern western society the use of computers for both vocational and avocational activities is almost universal. However, CVS may have a significant impact not only on visual comfort but also occupational productivity since between 64% and 90% of computer users experience visual symptoms which may include eyestrain, headaches, ocular discomfort, dry eye, diplopia and blurred vision either at near or when looking into the distance after prolonged computer use. This paper reviews the principal ocular causes for this condition, namely oculomotor anomalies and dry eye. Accommodation and vergence responses to electronic screens appear to be similar to those found when viewing printed materials, whereas the prevalence of dry eye symptoms is greater during computer operation. The latter is probably due to a decrease in blink rate and blink amplitude, as well as increased corneal exposure resulting from the monitor frequently being positioned in primary gaze. However, the efficacy of proposed treatments to reduce symptoms of CVS is unproven. A better understanding of the physiology underlying CVS is critical to allow more accurate diagnosis and treatment. This will enable practitioners to optimize visual comfort and efficiency during computer operation.","['Rosenfield, Mark']",['Rosenfield M'],"['SUNY College of Optometry, New York, NY, USA.

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred forty-one eyes of 75 healthy subjects were included in the study. Every subject was measured 3 times on 3 different days within 3 months. Differences among the tests were analyzed for mean sensitivity (MS), mean deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD), reliability indices, test duration, and test points <5% and <0.5% in 75 right eyes on the basis of linear mixed models for repeated measurements. To assess the effect of fatigue, differences of MS, MD, and PSD values between 66 left and right eyes were evaluated regarding alterations between these 3 examinations. RESULTS: After 3 test sessions, significant improvements were found in MS and MD among all 3 tests (P </= .01), and in PSD between test 1 and test 3 (P = .02). Test duration decreased significantly between tests 1 and 3 (P = .01); fixation-loss errors decreased significantly between tests 2 and 3 and between tests 1 and 3 (P = .02, respectively). Test points with p < 0.5% decreased significantly between tests 1 and 2 (P = .04) and 1 and 3 (P = .01) When comparing both eyes, MS, MD, and PSD were significantly better in first than in second eyes examined. CONCLUSIONS: There exist significant learning and fatigue effects for repeated flicker defined form perimetry. For good and reliable results on FDF perimetry, at least 3 tests should be performed in an individual. Between the tests of both eyes, a rest should be offered.","['Lamparter, Julia', 'Schulze, Andreas', 'Schuff, Ann-Christin', 'Berres, Manfred', 'Pfeiffer, Norbert', 'Hoffmann, Esther M']","['Lamparter J', 'Schulze A', 'Schuff AC', 'Berres M', 'Pfeiffer N', 'Hoffmann EM']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University Medical Center, Mainz University, Langenbeckstrasse 1, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ophthalmol,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500,AIM IM,,,,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/07/28 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9394(10)00960-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajo.2010.11.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ophthalmol. 2011 Jun;151(6):1057-1064.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.ajo.2010.11.031.

METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients with symptomatic convergence insufficiency treated with a home-based computer orthoptic program was performed. Symptomatic convergence insufficiency was defined as: near point of convergence (NPC) >6 cm, decreased positive fusional vergence, exophoria at near at least 4(Delta) greater than at far, and documented complaints of asthenopia, diplopia, or headaches with reading or near work. The Computer Orthoptics CVS program was used for this study. Before beginning the computer orthoptic program, patients with an NPC >50 cm were given 4 base-in prisms and push-up exercises (NPC exercises with an accommodative target) for 2 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included. Mean treatment duration was 12.6 weeks; mean follow-up, 8.5 months. Of the 42 patients, 35 were treated with the home-based computer orthoptic program and push-up exercises; the remaining 7 only used the computer orthoptic program. Because of a remote NPC, 5 patients were given base-in Fresnel prism before starting treatment. Baseline mean NPC was 24.2 cm; posttreatment mean NPC improved to 5.6 cm: 39 patients (92.8%) achieved an NPC of </=6 cm (p < 0.001). Positive fusional vergence improved in 39 patients (92.8%).

METHODS: Subjects were 44 optometry students (aged 23 to 34 years) without strabismus, amblyopia, or asthenopia during near work. They were randomized to begin at one of three examiners' stations: dissociated near phoria using Modified Thorington card; FD with Saladin card; and FD with Disparometer. Subjects proceeded to each station in turn. FD was measured for each subject through forced vergence demands of 0, 3, 6, and 9 base-in (BI), and 3, 6, 9, 16, and 20 base-out (BO), alternating BI and BO demands. Examiners were masked to subjects' results from the other stations. RESULTS: FD curve (FDC) types were the same with the two instruments in most cases. However, statistically significant differences were found for FDC slopes (p = 0.048), y intercepts (p < 0.0001), and FD values through BI prisms (p < 0.0001), with the Disparometer finding the FD to be more eso/less exo than did the Saladin card. FD values through BO prisms showed no statistically significant differences but great variability. CONCLUSIONS: The two instruments generally produce similar types of FDCs. However, the Disparometer tends to yield more eso/less exo FD measurements compared with the Saladin card. Although the newer Saladin card frequently produces FDC slopes and y intercepts within the expected range (as published for the Disparometer) for asymptomatic subjects, slopes and y intercepts obtained by the Saladin card are not sufficiently similar to those obtained by the Disparometer to warrant use of the same norms. Further study is needed to establish appropriate norms for the Saladin card.","['Frantz, Kelly A', 'Elston, Phillip', 'Michalik, Emily', 'Templeman, Carrah D', 'Zoltoski, Rebecca K']","['Frantz KA', 'Elston P', 'Michalik E', 'Templeman CD', 'Zoltoski RK']","['Illinois College of Optometry, Chicago, Illinois.

The distance from the screen to the eye remains fixed, providing a single focal distance, but the introduction of disparity between the images allows objects to be located geometrically in front of, or behind, the screen. Unlike in the real world, the stimulus to accommodation and the stimulus to convergence do not match. Although this mismatch is used positively in some forms of Orthoptic treatment, a number of authors have suggested that it could negatively lead to the development of asthenopic symptoms. From knowledge of the zone of clear, comfortable, single binocular vision one can predict that, for people with normal binocular vision, adverse symptoms will not be present if the discrepancy is small, but are likely if it is large, and that what constitutes 'large' and 'small' are idiosyncratic to the individual. The accommodation-convergence mismatch is not, however, the only difference between the natural and the artificial stimuli. In the former case, an object located in front of, or behind, a fixated object will not only be perceived as double if the images fall outside Panum's fusional areas, but it will also be defocused and blurred. In the latter case, however, it is usual for the producers of cinema, TV or computer game content to provide an image that is in focus over the whole of the display, and as a consequence diplopic images will be sharply in focus. The size of Panum's fusional area is spatial frequency-dependent, and because of this the high spatial frequencies present in the diplopic 3-D image will provide a different stimulus to the fusion system from that found naturally.","['Howarth, Peter A']",['Howarth PA'],"['Loughborough Design School, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK. p.a.howarth@lboro.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2011/02/12 06:00,2011/06/21 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00822.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2011 Mar;31(2):111-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00822.x.,['(c) 2011 The College of Optometrists.'],,20110620,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Asthenopia/*etiology', 'Computers', 'Distance Perception/*physiology', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Male', 'Motion Pictures', '*Television', 'Visual Perception']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 25 healthy, young volunteers participated in the study. Blink rate and blink amplitude were recorded in silent primary gaze conditions and while subjects were playing two computer games of similar cognitive demands but different rate of visual information presentation. For each experimental condition, tear volume was evaluated by measuring meniscus height and with the red phenol thread test. Fluorescein and non-invasive break-up time tests, as well as the observation of interference patterns and the estimation of the dry area extension, were employed to assess tear stability. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were revealed in blink rate (F = 595.85, p < 0.001) and blink amplitude (chi(2) = 34.00, p < 0.001), with blink rate during fast- and slow-paced game play decreasing to almost 1/3 and 1/2 of baseline levels, respectively, and with a larger percentage of incomplete blinks during dynamic tasks. Fluorescein and non-invasive break-up time tests and dry area extension were able to differentiate between experimental conditions in general (F = 408.42, p < 0.001; F = 163.49, p < 0.001; chi(2) = 20.74, p < 0.001), as well as between fast- and slow-paced games, thus suggesting that tear quality was more affected than tear volume. CONCLUSIONS: Blink rate, blink amplitude, and tear film stability were compromised during the most dynamic visual display terminal task, suggesting a negative influence of not only the cognitive aspects of the task, but also of the rate at which new visual information is presented. Frequent breaks and blinking awareness training are recommended for visual display terminal users requiring prolonged periods of visually demanding dynamic computer play or work.","['Cardona, Genis', 'Garcia, Carles', 'Seres, Carme', 'Vilaseca, Meritxell', 'Gispets, Joan']","['Cardona G', 'Garcia C', 'Seres C', 'Vilaseca M', 'Gispets J']","['Research Group of Centre Universitari de la Visio, Optics and Optometry Department, Technical University of Catalonia. gcardona@oo.upc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Curr Eye Res,Current eye research,8104312,IM,,,,2011/02/01 06:00,2011/06/24 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/02713683.2010.544442 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Eye Res. 2011 Mar;36(3):190-7. doi: 10.3109/02713683.2010.544442.

Ocular symptoms may include asthenopia, accommodative and vergence difficulties and dry eye. CVS occurs in up to 90% of computer workers, and given the almost universal use of these devices, it is important to identify whether these symptoms are specific to computer operation, or are simply a manifestation of performing a sustained near-vision task. METHOD: This study compared ocular symptoms immediately following a sustained near task. 30 young, visually-normal subjects read text aloud either from a desktop computer screen or a printed hardcopy page at a viewing distance of 50 cm for a continuous 20 min period. Identical text was used in the two sessions, which was matched for size and contrast. Target viewing angle and luminance were similar for the two conditions. Immediately following completion of the reading task, subjects completed a written questionnaire asking about their level of ocular discomfort during the task. RESULTS: When comparing the computer and hardcopy conditions, significant differences in median symptom scores were reported with regard to blurred vision during the task (t = 147.0; p = 0.03) and the mean symptom score (t = 102.5; p = 0.04). In both cases, symptoms were higher during computer use. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms following sustained computer use were significantly worse than those reported after hard copy fixation under similar viewing conditions. A better understanding of the physiology underlying CVS is critical to allow more accurate diagnosis and treatment. This will allow practitioners to optimize visual comfort and efficiency during computer operation.","['Chu, Christina', 'Rosenfield, Mark', 'Portello, Joan K', 'Benzoni, Jaclyn A', 'Collier, Juanita D']","['Chu C', 'Rosenfield M', 'Portello JK', 'Benzoni JA', 'Collier JD']","['SUNY College of Optometry, State University of New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/03/30 06:00,['2011/01/05 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1475-1313.2010.00802.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2011 Jan;31(1):29-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2010.00802.x.,,,20110329,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/etiology', 'Humans', '*Reading', 'Vision Disorders/*etiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Convergence and divergence 4 degrees step responses were compared between 13 control adult subjects with normal binocular vision and four CI adult subjects. All CI subjects participated in 18 h of vision therapy. Clinical parameters quantified throughout the therapy included: nearpoint of convergence, recovery point of convergence, positive fusional vergence at near, near dissociated phoria, and eye movements that were quantified using peak velocity. Neural correlates of the CI subjects were quantified with functional magnetic resonance imaging scans comparing random vs. predictable vergence movements using a block design before and after vision therapy. Images were quantified by measuring the spatial extent of activation and the average correlation within five regions of interests (ROI). The ROIs were the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a portion of the frontal lobe, part of the parietal lobe, the cerebellum, and the brain stem. All measurements were repeated 4 months to 1 year post-therapy in three of the CI subjects. RESULTS: Convergence average peak velocities to step stimuli were significantly slower (p = 0.016) in CI subjects compared with controls; however, significant differences in average peak velocities were not observed for divergence step responses (p = 0.30). The investigation of CI subjects participating in vision therapy showed that the nearpoint of convergence, recovery point of convergence, and near dissociated phoria significantly decreased. Furthermore, the positive fusional vergence, average peak velocity from 4 degrees convergence steps, and the amount of functional activity within the frontal areas, cerebellum, and brain stem significantly increased. Several clinical and cortical parameters were significantly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Convergence peak velocity was significantly slower in CI subjects compared with controls, which may result in asthenopic complaints reported by the CI subjects. Vision therapy was associated with and may have evoked clinical and cortical activity changes.","['Alvarez, Tara L', 'Vicci, Vincent R', 'Alkan, Yelda', 'Kim, Eun H', 'Gohel, Suril', 'Barrett, Anna M', 'Chiaravalloti, Nancy', 'Biswal, Bharat B']","['Alvarez TL', 'Vicci VR', 'Alkan Y', 'Kim EH', 'Gohel S', 'Barrett AM', 'Chiaravalloti N', 'Biswal BB']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersey 07102, USA. tara.l.alvarez@njit.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2010/11/09 06:00,2011/03/29 06:00,['2010/11/09 06:00'],"['2010/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0b013e3181fef1aa [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2010 Dec;87(12):E985-1002. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e3181fef1aa.,,,20110328,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', 'Brain Stem/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cerebellum/pathology/physiopathology', 'Convergence, Ocular', 'Eye Movements', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe/pathology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/complications/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Orthoptics/methods', 'Recovery of Function', 'Strabismus/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3134155,"['5R01NS055808/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5K02NS047099-6/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5R01NS049176/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS055808-01A2/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS055808-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS055808/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 HD062647/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 HD062647-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 NS047099-06/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 NS047099/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS049176/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS262089'],,,,,,,

Minimizing these conflicts is beneficial because they can cause distorted depth percepts, visual fatigue, and reduced stereoscopic performance. One proposed solution is to present a sum of images at multiple focal planes and to vary focal depth continuously by distributing image intensity across planes-a technique referred to as depth filtering. We evaluated this digital approximation to real-world variations in focal depth by measuring accommodation responses to depth-filtered stimuli at various simulated distances. Specifically, we determined the maximum image-plane separation that supported accurate and reliable accommodation. We used an analysis of retinal-image formation to predict when responses might be inaccurate. Accommodation to depth-filtered images was accurate and precise for image-plane separations up to approximately 1 diopter, suggesting that depth filtering can be used to precisely match accommodation and vergence demands in a practical display. At larger plane separations, responses broke down in a manner consistent with our analysis. We develop this approach to consider how different spatial frequencies contribute to accommodation control. The results suggest that higher spatial frequencies contribute less to the accommodation response than has previously been thought.","['MacKenzie, Kevin J', 'Hoffman, David M', 'Watt, Simon J']","['MacKenzie KJ', 'Hoffman DM', 'Watt SJ']","['Wolfson Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, School of Psychology, Bangor University, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales, UK. k.j.mackenzie@bangor.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Vis,Journal of vision,101147197,IM,,,,2010/10/05 06:00,2011/03/18 06:00,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.8.22 [pii]', '10.1167/10.8.22 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis. 2010 Jul 1;10(8):22. doi: 10.1167/10.8.22.,,20100701,20110317,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/physiopathology', 'Depth Perception/*physiology', 'Fixation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Reference Values', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such stimuli are uncharacteristic of natural images, and we examined whether visual discomfort more generally increases with deviations from the spatial and chromatic properties of natural scenes. Observers rated the level of discomfort or artistic merit in color images generated from noise or random overlapping rectangles (Mondrians). In one set, the slopes of the amplitude spectra for luminance or chromatic contrast were varied independently to create images ranging from strongly blurred to sharpened relative to a 'natural' 1/f spectrum. Perceived blur was dominated by the luminance slopes, with discomfort rated lowest for approximately 1/f spectra. In a second set of focused Mondrians, color was varied along different axes in the L-M versus S-LM chromatic plane. Discomfort ratings were lowest around bluish yellowish axes that are again typical of natural outdoor scenes. A final set varied in the levels of both luminance and chromatic contrast. Discomfort increased with increasing color contrast or decreasing luminance contrast, and tended toward lower ratings for images with balanced levels of luminance and color contrast. Notably, these ratings of discomfort were not related to judgments of artistic merit. Thus, for both spatial and chromatic content, the least aversive images corresponded to characteristic properties of the natural visual environment, and may reflect a normalization of visual coding to the natural world.","['Juricevic, Igor', 'Land, Leah', 'Wilkins, Arnold', 'Webster, Michael A']","['Juricevic I', 'Land L', 'Wilkins A', 'Webster MA']","['Department of Psychology, University of Nevada, 2601 Enterprise Road, Reno, NV 89512, USA. juricevi@univ.nevada.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Perception,Perception,0372307,IM,,,,2010/09/17 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1068/p6656 [doi]'],ppublish,Perception. 2010;39(7):884-99. doi: 10.1068/p6656.,,,20101216,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Color Perception/physiology', 'Contrast Sensitivity/*physiology', 'Female', 'Headache/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Pattern Recognition, Visual/*physiology', 'Photic Stimulation/*adverse effects', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",PMC2941908,"['R29 EY010834/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY010834-13/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', '/80274/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 EY010834/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-10834/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS208867'],,,,,,,

We evaluated the effects of intraoperative breaks during complex laparoscopic surgery (5 min every half hour) on the surgeon. METHODS: Fifty-one operations were randomized to a scheme with intraoperative breaks and release of the pneumoperitoneum (intermittent pneumoperitoneum (IPP)) or conventional conduct (CPP). Stress hormones and alpha-amylase were determined in the surgeon's saliva pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. Mental performance and error scores, musculoskeletal strain, and continuous ECG were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Regular intraoperative breaks did not prolong the operation (IPP vs. CPP group: 176 vs. 180 min, p > 0.05). The surgeon's cortisol levels during the operation were reduced by 22 +/- 10.3% in the IPP vs. the CPP group (p < 0.05). There were significantly fewer (p < 0.05) intraoperative events in the IPP vs. the CPP group, which yielded higher alpha-amylase peaks. The pre- to postoperative increase in the error rates of the bp-concentration test was fourfold reduced in the IPP group (p = 0.052). The relevant locomotive strain-scores were grossly reduced by IPP (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the idea that work breaks during complex laparoscopic surgery can reduce psychological stress and preserve performance without prolongation of the operation time compared with the traditional work scheme.","['Engelmann, Carsten', 'Schneider, Mischa', 'Kirschbaum, Clemens', 'Grote, Gudela', 'Dingemann, Jens', 'Schoof, Stefan', 'Ure, Benno M']","['Engelmann C', 'Schneider M', 'Kirschbaum C', 'Grote G', 'Dingemann J', 'Schoof S', 'Ure BM']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. ceng@bdc.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Surg Endosc,Surgical endoscopy,8806653,IM,,,,2010/09/14 06:00,2011/07/27 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00464-010-1350-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Surg Endosc. 2011 Apr;25(4):1245-50. doi: 10.1007/s00464-010-1350-1.

Only recently there have been significant scientific studies published that compare the effectiveness of the commonly prescribed treatments. This paper reviews the most recent research and literature on convergence insufficiency and its treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The first large-scale placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials to study the various treatments of convergence insufficiency have recently been published. Current research compares the effectiveness of base-in prism glasses, pencil push-ups, and vision therapy in reducing the signs and symptoms of convergence insufficiency and suggests that orthoptic therapy is the most efficacious treatment for convergence insufficiency. SUMMARY: Intensive orthoptic therapy is the treatment of choice for convergence insufficiency. Pencil push-ups and use of accommodative targets have a role in the treatment of convergence insufficiency when used as part of a more intensive orthoptic program. Base-in prism glasses should be reserved for reduction of symptoms in the presbyopic population.","['Lavrich, Judith B']",['Lavrich JB'],"['Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Wills Eye Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA. jbl123@verizon.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Ophthalmol,Current opinion in ophthalmology,9011108,IM,,,,2010/07/17 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/ICU.0b013e32833cf03a [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 2010 Sep;21(5):356-60. doi: 10.1097/ICU.0b013e32833cf03a.,,,20101104,,,"['Adolescent', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Child', '*Convergence, Ocular', 'Exotropia/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Orthoptics', 'Vision, Binocular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 33.5% of outbound operators and 27.1% of inbound operators reported frequently or always experiencing high stress at work, however, the differences between inbound and outbound operators were insignificant. ""Having to deal with difficult customers"" was the most frequent job stressor for all workers. Musculoskeletal discomfort, eye strain, and hoarse or sore throat were the most prevalent complaints among call center workers. The relationship between perceived job stress and health complaints indicated that workers who perceived higher job stress had significantly increased risk of multiple health problems, including eye strain, tinnitus, hoarse or sore throat, chronic cough with phlegm, chest tightness, irritable stomach or peptic ulcers, and musculoskeletal discomfort (with odds ratios ranging from 2.13 to 8.24).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects in the first trial were 10 healthy volunteers (10 eyes). Following VDT, subjects wore either a warming eye steamer (water vapor: 200 mg/10 min) or an eye mask with their eyelids closed for 10 minutes. Subjects in the second trial were 5 healthy volunteers (5 eyes). Following VDT, subjects applied either a dry-warming sheet (water vapor: 0 mg/10 min) or a wet-warming sheet (water vapor: 20, 35, 160 and 200 mg/10 min) to there eyelids and the periocular region for 10 minutes. In both experiments, subjective amplitude of accommodation, pupillary reaction, convergence reaction, near vision, and breakup time were measured before and immediately after VDT work and after 2 experimental settings. RESULTS: The warming eye steamer significantly improved amplitude of accommodation (p<0.05), and near vision (p<0.05). Warming the periocular region with water vapor improved subjective amplitude of accommodation, and near vision, the effect of which depended on the amount of water vapor (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Warming the periocular region with water vapor improved subjective amplitude of accommodation, near vision and the effect depended on the amount of water vapor.","['Takahashi, Yoko', 'Igaki, Michihito', 'Sakamoto, Ichirou', 'Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Takahashi, Genichiro', 'Dogru, Murat', 'Tsubota, Kazuo']","['Takahashi Y', 'Igaki M', 'Sakamoto I', 'Suzuki A', 'Takahashi G', 'Dogru M', 'Tsubota K']","['Doshisha University Anti-Aging Medical Research Center, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,,,,2010/06/16 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2010 May;114(5):444-53.,,,20100803,['0 (Steam)'],,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/therapy', 'Convergence, Ocular/*physiology', 'Eyelids/physiology', 'Female', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Presbyopia/therapy', 'Pupil/physiology', '*Steam', 'Visual Acuity/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Initially 22 subjects (mean age 11.8 years, +/-3.54 SD) with AI were included in the study. The treatment was given according to a randomization list; 11 subjects were given +1.00 D reading addition and the other 11 were given +2.00 D reading addition, for 8 weeks of treatment. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the subjective degree of asthenopia before and after treatment. RESULTS: The results showed a statistical significant improvement of the accommodative amplitude with +1.00 D reading addition after 8 weeks of treatment. In the +2.00 D reading addition group the improvement of accommodative amplitude was not significant. The reduction in VAS score was significant in both groups. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that +2.00 D reading addition does not exercise the accommodative system in the same amount as +1.00 D reading addition to improve the accommodative amplitude. We therefore recommend that +2.00 D reading addition is not used for treatment of AI.","['Wahlberg, Marika', 'Abdi, Saber', 'Brautaset, Rune']","['Wahlberg M', 'Abdi S', 'Brautaset R']","['Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. marika.wahlberg@ste.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Strabismus,Strabismus,9310896,IM,,,,2010/06/05 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/06/05 06:00'],"['2010/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09273972.2010.485243 [doi]'],ppublish,Strabismus. 2010 Jun;18(2):67-71. doi: 10.3109/09273972.2010.485243.,,,20100930,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/etiology', 'Child', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Optics and Photonics', 'Pain Measurement', '*Reading', 'Vision Disorders/complications/*physiopathology/*rehabilitation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study determined the pattern of refractive ocular conditions, reasons for spectacles renewal and the effect of correction on refractive errors in a resource-limited community. METHODS: A retrospective review of case records of 1,413 consecutive patients seen in a private optometry practice, Nigeria between January 2006 and July 2007. RESULTS: A total number of 1,216 (86.1%) patients comprising of (486, 40%) males and (730, 60%) females with a mean age of 41.02 years SD 14.19 were analyzed. The age distribution peaked at peri-adolescent and the middle age years. The main ocular complaints were spectacles loss and discomfort (412, 33.9%), blurred near vision (399, 32.8%) and asthenopia (255, 20.9%). The mean duration of ocular symptoms before consultation was 2.05 years SD 1.92. The most common refractive errors include presbyopia (431, 35.3%), hyperopic astigmatism (240, 19.7%) and presbyopia with hyperopia (276, 22.7%). Only (59, 4.9%) had myopia. Following correction, there were reductions in magnitudes of the blind (VA<3/60) and visually impaired (VA<6/18-3/60) patients by (18, 58.1%) and (89, 81.7%) respectively. The main reasons for renewal of spectacles were broken lenses/frame/scratched lenses/lenses' falling off (47, 63.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Adequate correction of refractive errors reduces visual impairment and avoidable blindness and to achieve optimal control of refractive errors in the community, services should be targeted at individuals in the peri-adolescent and the middle age years.","['Ayanniyi, Abdulkabir A', 'Folorunso, Francisca N', 'Adepoju, Feyisayo G']","['Ayanniyi AA', 'Folorunso FN', 'Adepoju FG']","['Department of Ophthalmology, College of Health Sciences, University of Abuja, Abuja, PMB 117, FCT, Nigeria. ayanniyikabir@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Ophthalmol,BMC ophthalmology,100967802,IM,,,,2010/05/13 06:00,2010/08/19 06:00,['2010/05/13 06:00'],"['2009/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2415-10-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2415-10-12 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Ophthalmol. 2010 May 7;10:12. doi: 10.1186/1471-2415-10-12.,,20100507,20100818,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blindness/epidemiology', 'Child', '*Developing Countries', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Prevalence', 'Refractive Errors/*rehabilitation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Visually Impaired Persons/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC2885324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the mechanism for the induction of light-induced fatigue and asthenopia, changes in the mouse were analyzed after white light-irradiation to the eye. METHODS: C57BL/6j male mice were irradiated with white light in a specially designed room equipped with four mirrors covering all areas of its four walls to elicit diffused reflected light, and changes in their plasma levels of cortisol, INF-gamma, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) were analyzed. RESULTS: Irradiation of mice with scattered white light significantly decreased the motional activity of animals, suggesting the occurrence of fatigue. Biochemical analysis and enzyme-immunoassay revealed that the irradiation of mice significantly elevated the plasma levels of cortisol, IFN-gamma, IL-10 and TGF-beta. All these changes were not observed with mice irradiated with the light in a similar room not equipped with mirrors. These changes were successfully inhibited by a polarized glass filter but not by a non-polarized filter with a similar absorbance. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that irradiation of the eye by scattered reflected light stimulated a stress response via hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis to enhance the secretion of cortisol from the adrenal grand and increase the plasma levels of cytokines.","['Hiramoto, Keiichi', 'Yamate, Yurika', 'Orita, Kumi', 'Jikumaru, Mika', 'Kasahara, Emiko', 'Sato, Eisuke F', 'Tamura, Shinzo', 'Inoue, Masayasu']","['Hiramoto K', 'Yamate Y', 'Orita K', 'Jikumaru M', 'Kasahara E', 'Sato EF', 'Tamura S', 'Inoue M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Osaka City University Medical School, Abeno, Osaka, Japan. hiramoto@msic.med.osaka-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed,"Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",9013641,IM,,,,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['PPP497 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0781.2010.00497.x [doi]']",ppublish,Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed. 2010 Apr;26(2):89-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0781.2010.00497.x.,,,20100719,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,"['Animals', 'Asthenopia/*blood/etiology', 'Behavior, Animal/radiation effects', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Eye/metabolism', 'Fatigue/*blood/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*blood', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*metabolism', 'Light/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper discusses a new view that has emerged, one that focuses on the management rather than the elimination of work related upper limb disorders (WRULD) and computer vision syndrome (CVS) issues that are prevalent among eWorkers. It also reviews a cultural shift among practitioners and business that moves towards a consultative process and the sharing of knowledge among all stakeholders. The controlled work conditions and large single location workforce found within contact centres provide the opportunity to understand the personal and industry cost of eWork injuries and the ability to develop and review new multifaceted interventions.

The measurement results from the instrument were compared by Kappa test with the clinical impression and comprehensive impression based on measurement results and clinical information. RESULTS: The abnormality rate of accommodation of the patients were 61.5%, 46.2%, 61.5% from the instrument, clinical impression and comprehensive impression respectively. The agreement was weak with Kappa value 0.244 between results from the instrument and clinical impression. The agreement was mild with Kappa value 0.513 between results from the instrument and comprehensive impression. The agreement was high with Kappa value 0.698 between results from clinical impression and comprehensive impression.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study based on local residents in this community was carried out from September 2008 to October 2008. Cluster sampling was used in randomly selecting individuals aged > or = 60 years. Slit-lamp ophthalmoscope was used for eye examination and diagnosis. The survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance evaluation was carried out. A database was set using SPSS 10.0 software, Chi-square test was used for data analysis. RESULTS: 2110 residents took part in this study, with the response rate 94.85%. 930 cases (1762 eyes) were confirmed as conjunctivochalasis, so the prevalence rate is 44.08%. The prevalence of conjunctivochalasis was increasing with age (chi(2) = 10.44, P < 0.01). 556 cases (943 eyes) were confirmed as degree I, 246 cases (647 eyes) as degree II, 120 cases (162 eyes) as degree III and the rest 8 cases (10 eyes) as degree IV. Several symptoms, such as blurred vision, asthenopia and eye pain were more frequent in patient group than in the normal ones (chi(2) value was 15.44, 20.54 and 19.74, respectively, P < 0.01). In the disease eyes, the conjunctiva usually piled up on the nasal and temporal side (944 eyes, 53.58%), the location of inferior lid margin was usually above corneal limbus (2589 eyes, 61.35%) and inferior lid margin entropion and introversion were always found (7.04% and 6.63%). Abnormal lacrimal river was found in 87.23% of the diseased eyes, more than the non-conjunctivochalasis eyes (chi(2) = 1615.81, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctivochalasis is a common eye disease in aged population, with obvious signs and symptoms of ocular surface and lacrimal river impairment. In the local residents, most patients were classified as minimal or moderate degree. The location of inferior lid margin and the tension of inferior lid may be related factor of conjunctivochalasis.","['Li, Qing-song', 'Zhang, Xing-ru', 'Zou, Hai-dong', 'Peng, Jin-juan', 'Shi, Cai-cai', 'Zhou, Huan-ming', 'Zhang, Gui-li', 'Xiang, Min-hong', 'Li, Yi-jie']","['Li QS', 'Zhang XR', 'Zou HD', 'Peng JJ', 'Shi CC', 'Zhou HM', 'Zhang GL', 'Xiang MH', 'Li YJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Putuo Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Medicine, Shanghai 200062, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,16210540R,IM,,,,2010/02/09 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Sep;45(9):793-8.,,,20101216,,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'China/epidemiology', 'Conjunctival Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-six children age 8 to 10 years were examined. Convergence was evaluated using (1) nonaccommodative target at near and distance, (2) a near computerized stereogram, and (3) measurement of the near point of convergence (NPC). Reading ability was examined by (1) a reading comprehension test in which children had to answer questions regarding a paragraph they read and (2) the Developmental Eye Movement Test (DEM), which evaluates saccadic speed and accuracy. Asthenopic symptoms were scored by an Asthenopic Symptoms Questionnaire. RESULTS: Asthenopic symptoms score was correlated with the near point of convergence (r = -0.4; P = 0.003), convergence on a near stereogram (r = 0.38; P = 0.01) and distant light (r = 0.27; P = 0.04), but not with convergence on a near nonaccommodative target (r = 0.07; P = 0.6). The DEM ratio score was correlated with the asthenopic symptoms score (r = -0.32; P = 0.01), but the reading comprehension test score was not (r = 0.12; P = 0.4). There was correlation, however, between the time for completion of the reading comprehension test and the asthenopic symptoms score (r = 0.39; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Asthenopic symptoms score was correlated with convergence amplitude as measured, whereas accommodation is controlled and the ratio score calculated based upon DEM results. Further study is needed to evaluate the usefulness of the integration between symptom survey and objective reading examinations as screening tool for the diagnosis of convergence insufficiency.","['Cohen, Yuval', 'Segal, Ori', 'Barkana, Yaniv', 'Lederman, Robert', 'Zadok, David', 'Pras, Eran', 'Morad, Yair']","['Cohen Y', 'Segal O', 'Barkana Y', 'Lederman R', 'Zadok D', 'Pras E', 'Morad Y']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Zrifin, Israel. ymorad@013.net.il']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Optometry,"Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)",100912421,IM,,,,2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2007/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1529-1839(09)00460-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.optm.2008.10.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Optometry. 2010 Jan;81(1):28-34. doi: 10.1016/j.optm.2008.10.019.,,,20100318,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Convergence, Ocular/*physiology', 'Depth Perception/*physiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fixation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reading', 'Saccades/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-five drivers with OSA and 41 comparison drivers participated in an hour-long drive in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Drivers responded to light targets flashed at seven locations across the forward horizon. Dependent measures were percent correct [hit rate (HR)] and reaction time (RT). Self-assessment of sleepiness used the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) before and after the drive and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). RESULTS: OSA drivers showed reduced vigilance based on lower HR than comparison drivers, especially for peripheral targets (80.7+/-14.8% vs. 86.7+/-8.8%, P=.03). OSA drivers were sleepier at the end of the drive than comparison drivers (SSS=4.2+/-1.2 vs. 3.6+/-1.2, P=.03), and increased sleepiness correlated with decreased HR only in those with OSA (r=-0.49, P=.01). Lower HR and higher post-drive SSS predicted greater numbers of driving errors in all subjects. Yet, ESS, predrive SSS, and most objective measures of disease severity failed to predict driving and vigilance performance in OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced vigilance for peripheral visual targets indicates that OSA drivers have restriction of their effective field of view, which may partly explain their increased crash risk. This fatigue-related decline in attention is predicted by increased subjective sleepiness during driving. These findings may suggest a means of identifying and counseling high-risk drivers and aid in the development of in-vehicle alerting and warning devices.","['Tippin, Jon', 'Sparks, JonDavid', 'Rizzo, Matthew']","['Tippin J', 'Sparks J', 'Rizzo M']","['Department of Neurology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA. jon-tippin@uiowa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Psychosom Res,Journal of psychosomatic research,0376333,IM,,,,2009/07/21 09:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2008/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-3999(09)00129-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Psychosom Res. 2009 Aug;67(2):143-51. doi: 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.03.015.

However, recent studies show that the clinical push-up test used to measure amplitude overestimates accommodative function. This study uses an open-field autorefractor to measure accommodative stimulus-response functions objectively in college students with and without near work induced discomfort symptoms. METHODS: Using a Grand-Seiko WAM 5500 autorefractor, 2 min recordings were made each at five viewing distances (0 to 5 D) to measure an accommodative response function. Visual discomfort symptoms were assessed using the Conlon survey. RESULTS: A strong and positive correlation between accommodative lag and visual discomfort symptoms was found under near work conditions. The prevalence of accommodative insufficiency was much higher than estimated by clinical measures. CONCLUSIONS: Accommodative insufficiency and fatigue should be defined and described by objective methods using extended viewing times to assess function.","['Chase, Chris', 'Tosha, Chinatsu', 'Borsting, Eric', 'Ridder, William H 3rd']","['Chase C', 'Tosha C', 'Borsting E', 'Ridder WH 3rd']","['Colleges of Optometry and Biomedical Sciences, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA 91766-1854, USA. cchase@westernu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2009/06/13 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OPX.0b013e3181ae1b7c [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2009 Jul;86(7):883-9. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e3181ae1b7c.,,,20090916,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', '*Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological/instrumentation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Optometry/methods', 'Photic Stimulation/methods', 'Pupil', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,['R15EY015922/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critical flicker frequency (CFF), accommodation power, visual acuity, and subjective rating of visual fatigue were evaluated at four different stages: without screen filter, screen filter use of 2.5 mo., 5 mo., and 12 mo. For each stage, all measurements were taken before and after an 8-hr. workday. Analysis of variance was performed to test whether the screen filter use or measurement time had a significant effect on any of the visual fatigue measurements. The results indicated visual acuity was significantly improved after the use of a screen filter, while after the screen filter was installed, the CFF reading showed visual fatigue was more pronounced. Significant improvement in subjective ratings of double vision on screen was found after the screen filter use of 2.5 mo., but improvements disappeared after continuous use at 5 mo. A Hawthorne effect could have contributed to the short-term relief in visual fatigue and inconsistent findings in other visual performance measurements. Sorting out frequently used questions into a few definable areas and data sets might reduce the screen viewing time and visual fatigue more effectively.","['Chi, Chia-Fen', 'Lin, Yen-Hui']","['Chi CF', 'Lin YH']","['Department of Industrial Management, National Taiwan University of Science & Technology, 43 Keelung Road, Section 4, Taipei 106, Taiwan. chris@mail.ntust.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Percept Mot Skills,Perceptual and motor skills,0401131,IM,,,,2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/11 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2466/PMS.108.1.229-238 [doi]'],ppublish,Percept Mot Skills. 2009 Feb;108(1):229-38. doi: 10.2466/PMS.108.1.229-238.,,,20090610,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Computer Communication Networks/*instrumentation', '*Computer Terminals', 'Data Display', 'Equipment Design', 'Ergonomics/instrumentation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Visual Acuity/physiology', 'Work Schedule Tolerance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The responses were compared with those of a reference group of 28 healthy subjects without pain. Pain intensity was rated on a visual analogue scale. Intramuscular blood flux was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and muscle activity by surface EMG bilaterally in the upper trapezius. Pain increased during the work task, and the increase was larger in women than in men and in the reference group. Muscle activity was low: <4% of EMG during maximal voluntary contraction. LDF showed elevated intramuscular blood flux above baseline throughout the work task in both groups and during recovery in the pain group. Pain in the active side correlated positively with blood flux in the pain-afflicted subjects and negatively in the reference group. In conclusion, office work induced pain, and trapezius vasodilation that did not return to resting values during recovery. These data show that pain is associated with trapezius vasodilation but not with muscle activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testing this hypothesis required an ability to measure eyestrain. This capability was developed by measuring the visual accommodation of radiologists before and after diagnostic viewing work using an autorefractor that was capable of making multiple measurements of accommodation per second. Three radiologists and three residents focused on a simple target placed at near to far distances while accommodation was measured. The target distances varied from 20 to 183 cm from the eye. The data were collected prior to and after a day of digital diagnostic viewing. RESULTS: The results indicated that accommodation at near distances was significantly worse overall compared to far distances and was significantly worse after a day of digital reading at all distances. CONCLUSIONS: Because diagnostic image interpretation is performed at near viewing distances, this inability to maintain focus on an image could affect diagnostic accuracy. As expected, younger residents had better accommodative accuracy than older radiologists.","['Krupinski, Elizabeth A', 'Berbaum, Kevin S']","['Krupinski EA', 'Berbaum KS']","['Department of Radiology, University of Arizona, 1609 N Warren, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA. krupinski@radiology.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Acad Radiol,Academic radiology,9440159,IM,,,,2009/05/02 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1076-6332(09)00138-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.acra.2009.02.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Acad Radiol. 2009 Aug;16(8):947-50. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2009.02.008.

Three critical factors--choice of surface treatment, ambient illumination, and bending curvature--are evaluated through the method of a letter-search task. The results show that subjects performed better on legibility and felt less visual fatigue with an anti-glare treatment. Choosing the better anti-glare treatment instead of the anti-reflection series can save significant cost for manufacturers. In addition, ambient lighting of 1500 lux is more appropriate for reading on electronic paper than an environment with extreme illumination (e.g., 8000 lux). The present study also found that curvature had no impact on legibility or visual fatigue. These evaluations of simulated electronic paper may provide manufacturers useful information in fulfilling ergonomic requirements for product design.","['Lin, Yu-Ting', 'Lin, Po-Hung', 'Hwang, Sheue-Ling', 'Jeng, Shie-Chang', 'Liao, Chi-Chang']","['Lin YT', 'Lin PH', 'Hwang SL', 'Jeng SC', 'Liao CC']","['Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, National Tsing Hua University, 101 Section 2 Kuang-Fu Road, Hsinchu, Taiwan. d943847@oz.nthu.edu.tw']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Appl Ergon,Applied ergonomics,0261412,IM,,,,2009/03/03 09:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-6870(09)00007-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.apergo.2009.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Ergon. 2009 Sep;40(5):922-8. doi: 10.1016/j.apergo.2009.01.003.

METHODS: Subjects were screened for visual acuity and uncorrected refractive error before participating in the study. A survey of visual discomfort developed by Conlon et al., Vis Cogn 1999;6:637-666, and the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) were administered to a group of 23 college students twice with approximately 1 year between administrations. All subjects also completed two clinical assessments of accommodation and vergence. RESULTS: The mean time between administrations of the symptom surveys was 13 months. There was no clinically significant mean difference between the first and second administration of both visual discomfort surveys. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.82 for the Conlon et al., Vis Cogn 1999;6:637-666 survey and 0.85 for the CISS. The 95% limits of agreement for the Conlon et al., Vis Cogn 1999;6:637-666 survey was -18.44, 17.92 and for the CISS was -14.36, 13.36. The intraclass correlation coefficient values for the optometric tests ranged from 0.38 to 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: Visual discomfort symptoms were found to be stable in the majority of young college students over a 1 year period.

The authors investigated the effects of exposure to blue-enriched white light during daytime workhours in an office setting. METHODS: The experiment was conducted on 104 white-collar workers on two office floors. After baseline assessments under existing lighting conditions, every participant was exposed to two new lighting conditions, each lasting 4 weeks. One consisted of blue-enriched white light (17 000 K) and the other of white light (4000 K). The order was balanced between the floors. Questionnaire and rating scales were used to assess alertness, mood, sleep quality, performance, mental effort, headache and eye strain, and mood throughout the 8-week intervention. RESULTS: Altogether 94 participants [mean age 36.4 (SD 10.2) years] were included in the analysis. Compared with white light (4000 K), blue-enriched white light (17 000 K) improved the subjective measures of alertness (P<0.0001), positive mood (P=0.0001), performance (P<0.0001), evening fatigue (P=0.0001), irritability (P=0.004), concentration (P<0.0001), and eye discomfort (P=0.002). Daytime sleepiness was reduced (P=0.0001), and the quality of subjective nocturnal sleep (P=0.016) was improved under blue-enriched white light. When the participants' expectation about the effect of the light treatments was entered into the analysis as a covariate, significant effects persisted for performance, alertness, evening fatigue, irritability, difficulty focusing, concentrating, and blurred vision. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to blue-enriched white light during daytime workhours improves subjective alertness, performance, and evening fatigue.","['Viola, Antoine U', 'James, Lynette M', 'Schlangen, Luc J M', 'Dijk, Derk-Jan']","['Viola AU', 'James LM', 'Schlangen LJ', 'Dijk DJ']","['Surrey Sleep Research Centre, Clinical Research Centre, Egerton Road, Guildford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,IM,,,,2008/09/26 09:00,2008/12/31 09:00,['2008/09/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1268 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.1268 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2008 Aug;34(4):297-306. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.1268.

An investigation with FPI-R and NEI-VQ].,570-6,10.1055/s-2008-1027417 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Visual restrictions can lead to anxiety and possibly to social retirement. Therefore it makes sense to assess the patients' degree of handicap. The goal of the present study was to investigate if patients show changes in their personality or a reduced quality of life as a result of their visual field defect. METHODS: 15 patients with visual field defects were asked to fill out the revised version of the Freiburger Personlichkeitsinventar (FPI-R) and the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). The FPI-R encompasses the standardised recording of many personality traits whereas the NEI-VFQ addresses the visual quality of life. RESULTS: In the total sample all FPI-R scales were appropriate for the study in the inconspicuous standard range. Slight shifts resulted toward increased willingness to make contacts (scale 4, ST 4.2), reduced physical strain (scale 7, ST 4.3) and lower physical discomfort (scale 8, ST 3.7). The size of the visual field defect does not correlate with the satisfaction with life, with the physical discomfort and with the state of health but with the dependency on others (p = 0.047) and with the exertion of their social roles (p = 0.043). The scale ""satisfaction with life"" of the FPI-R correlated with the scale ""psychic condition"" of the NEI-VFQ (p = 0.028) and the physical discomfort showed a significant correlation with the scale ""eye strain"" (p = 0.006) in the NEI-VFQ. DISCUSSION: Contrary to our presumptions, patients with visual field defects did not show any changes in their personality. It is supposed that they have learned to compensate for their reduced visual functions.","['Jobke, S', 'Kasten, E', 'Sabel, B A']","['Jobke S', 'Kasten E', 'Sabel BA']","['Institut Medizin.

In many of these applications, it is important for the graphic image to create a faithful impression of the 3D structure of the portrayed object or scene. Unfortunately, 3D displays often yield distortions in perceived 3D structure compared with the percepts of the real scenes the displays depict. A likely cause of such distortions is the fact that computer displays present images on one surface. Thus, focus cues-accommodation and blur in the retinal image-specify the depth of the display rather than the depths in the depicted scene. Additionally, the uncoupling of vergence and accommodation required by 3D displays frequently reduces one's ability to fuse the binocular stimulus and causes discomfort and fatigue for the viewer. We have developed a novel 3D display that presents focus cues that are correct or nearly correct for the depicted scene. We used this display to evaluate the influence of focus cues on perceptual distortions, fusion failures, and fatigue. We show that when focus cues are correct or nearly correct, (1) the time required to identify a stereoscopic stimulus is reduced, (2) stereoacuity in a time-limited task is increased, (3) distortions in perceived depth are reduced, and (4) viewer fatigue and discomfort are reduced. We discuss the implications of this work for vision research and the design and use of displays.","['Hoffman, David M', 'Girshick, Ahna R', 'Akeley, Kurt', 'Banks, Martin S']","['Hoffman DM', 'Girshick AR', 'Akeley K', 'Banks MS']","['Vision Science Program, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. davidhoffman@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Vis,Journal of vision,101147197,IM,,,,2008/05/20 09:00,2008/06/13 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1167/8.3.33 [doi]', '8/3/33 [pii]']",epublish,J Vis. 2008 Mar 28;8(3):33.1-30. doi: 10.1167/8.3.33.,,20080328,20080612,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Computer Terminals', 'Cues', 'Depth Perception/*physiology', 'Flicker Fusion/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Reference Values', 'Space Perception/*physiology', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology']",PMC2879326,"['R01 EY014194/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-014194/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY014194-02/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 EY007043/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-07043/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY014194-01/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 EY007043/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS202260'],,,,,,,

METHODS: Initially, 24 subjects (mean age 10.3 years, +/- 2.5 SD) with AI were included in the study. Ten subjects completed 8 weeks of PRLA treatment whereas 9, out of 14, subjects completed 8 weeks of spherical flipper treatment. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant improvement in the accommodative amplitude with both regimes of treatment [F(1, 17) = 18.84, p = 0.0004). Spherical flipper treatment was found to have an overall larger effect on accommodative function as compared with PLRA treatment. However, accommodation did not reach normal values after only 8 weeks of treatment. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that both methods improve the accommodative amplitude, but that overall accommodative function reaches higher levels of improvement with spherical flipper as compared with PLRA treatment. However, the accommodative function did not gain normal values in 8 weeks of treatment with either regime.","['Brautaset, Rune', 'Wahlberg, Marika', 'Abdi, Saber', 'Pansell, Tony']","['Brautaset R', 'Wahlberg M', 'Abdi S', 'Pansell T']","['Unit of Optometry, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Strabismus,Strabismus,9310896,IM,,,,2008/05/20 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['793164821 [pii]', '10.1080/09273970802039763 [doi]']",ppublish,Strabismus. 2008 Apr-Jun;16(2):65-9. doi: 10.1080/09273970802039763.,,,20080703,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Asthenopia/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Equipment Design', 'Exercise Therapy/*methods', '*Eyeglasses', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/complications/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Young VDT workers who visited the clinic because of eye strain were consecutively selected. Fifteen workers who were under-corrected for myopia and three workers who were over-corrected for myopia were treated by ""adequate correction of refractory errors"" with spectacles or soft contact lenses. The adequate correction was defined as minimum convex lenses which could obtain visual acuity of 1.2 or better, similar to daily life conditions, without cyclopegia or fogging. The workers were in their 20's. Accommodative responses to step stimuli were recorded by infrared optometer, and questionnaires were filled out by the VDT workers concerning the severity (a severity rating in percent in five steps) of subjective symptoms (headache, dry eye, eye strain, and eye irritation). Spectacles or disposable contact lenses were prescribed for the workers for ""adequate correction"". Six months later, accommodative responses and subjective symptoms were evaluated and compared with under-or over-corrected conditions and adequate correction. RESULTS: In under-corrected workers, the adequate correction significantly improved complains i.e. headache, eye strain, eye tiredness (p < 0.005). Accommodative responses also improved in gain (%), maximum velocity (D/sec), and time of accommodation and relaxation (p < 0.05). Three over-corrected workers showed improvement of complains and also accommodative response in gain, maximum velocity, and time of accommodation and relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: Application of ""adequate correction"" to young VDT workers with asthenopia by using adequately corrected spectacles or soft contact lenses improved the asthenopia and accommodative dynamics.","['Kotegawa, Yasue', 'Hara, Naoto', 'Ono, Koji', 'Arimoto, Ako', 'Mukuno, Kazuo']","['Kotegawa Y', 'Hara N', 'Ono K', 'Arimoto A', 'Mukuno K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Kanagawa Dental College Yokohama Dental and Medical Clinic, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,,,,2008/05/01 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/05/01 09:00'],"['2008/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2008 Apr;112(4):376-81.,,,20080530,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology/*therapy', '*Computer Terminals', 'Contact Lenses', 'Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Refractive Errors/*therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Charts of patients examined in the Raymond J. Greenwald Rehabilitation Center at the SUNY State College of Optometry from the years 2000 to 2003 were reviewed. Only TBI (n=160) or CVA (n=60) patients were included. Prescribed medications from 12 possible categories were identified. Patients experiencing blurred vision, diplopia, asthenopia, poor depth perception, and/or light sensitivity were identified. Patients with accommodative dysfunction, vergence dysfunction, versional dysfunction, dry eyes, and/or ptosis were also identified. RESULTS: The 4 most common medication categories taken by TBI patients were anti-anxiety/antidepressants (42.5%), anticonvulsants (26.9%), opiate/combination analgesics (23.8%), and cardiac/antihypertensives (23.1%). For the CVA patients, the medications were cardiac/antihypertensives (66.7%), anti-anxiety/antidepressants (31.7%), vitamins/mineral supplements (26.7%), and anticonvulsants (23.3%). Frequency of vision symptoms and diagnoses in the TBI and CVA patients appeared not to be related to medication use in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants were the overlapping medication categories between the TBI and CVA groups. Medication intake did not affect the frequency of the reported vision symptoms and diagnoses in most cases, suggesting the symptoms and diagnoses were primarily related to either the TBI or CVA itself.","['Han, M H Esther', 'Craig, Shoshana B', 'Rutner, Daniella', 'Kapoor, Neera', 'Ciuffreda, Kenneth J', 'Suchoff, Irwin B']","['Han MH', 'Craig SB', 'Rutner D', 'Kapoor N', 'Ciuffreda KJ', 'Suchoff IB']","['State University of New York State College of Optometry, New York, New York 10036, USA. mhan@synuopt.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Optometry,"Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)",100912421,IM,,,,2008/04/26 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/04/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1529-1839(08)00003-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.optm.2008.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Optometry. 2008 May;79(5):252-8. doi: 10.1016/j.optm.2008.01.001.,,,20080822,"['0 (Anti-Anxiety Agents)', '0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Antidepressive Agents)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use', 'Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Brain Injuries/complications/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stroke/complications/*drug therapy', 'Vision Disorders/*etiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-four Visual Display Unit (VDU) operators reported significantly worsened condition of lighting and glare in addition to increased visual discomfort. For visual discomfort, the difference with 95% confidence interval was 10.7 (1.9-19.5) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) as group mean value. The most reasonable explanation for these results may be that the operators were glared from high luminance from the windows, when the Venetian blinds were not properly used. Glare was significantly correlated with visual discomfort, rs=0.35. Both illuminance and luminance in the work area, and contrast reduction on the VDU screen were in line with recommendations from CIE for VDU work. In a regression analysis, the visual discomfort explained 53% of the variance in the neck and shoulder pain. In the office landscape, the eye blink rate during habitual VDU work was recorded for 12 randomly selected operators from the 34 participants. A marked drop in eye blink rate during VDU work was found when this was compared to ""easy conversation"" (VDU work, mean=9.7 blinks per minute; ""easy conversation,"" mean=21.4 blinks per minute). Participants reported many of the organizational and psychosocial conditions and work factors worse when landscape office was compared to single occupancy office. These factors may have influenced the musculoskeletal pain. However, the pain level was still low at 6 years and not significantly different when compared with the start of the study period, except for a small but significant increase in shoulder pain. In this study, visual discomfort is clearly associated with pain in the neck and shoulder area.","['Helland, Magne', 'Horgen, Gunnar', 'Kvikstad, Tor Martin', 'Garthus, Tore', 'Bruenech, Jan Richard', 'Aaras, Arne']","['Helland M', 'Horgen G', 'Kvikstad TM', 'Garthus T', 'Bruenech JR', 'Aaras A']","['Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Buskerud University College, PO Box 235, N-3601 Kongsberg, Norway. magne.helland@hibu.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Appl Ergon,Applied ergonomics,0261412,IM,,,,2008/01/08 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-6870(07)00095-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.apergo.2007.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Ergon. 2008 May;39(3):284-95. doi: 10.1016/j.apergo.2007.10.005.

Prognosis was known to be better in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) than those with non-NF1. The confusion over management is caused, at least in part, by the uncertain disease course of the tumor. CASE HISTORY: We report here a 13-year-old girl presented with a 1-month history of a gradual decline of vision in her left eye. She was diagnosed by clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging as having a left optic-nerve glioma and was followed by serial magnetic resonance imaging over 3 years. She and her family did not show any stigmata of NF1. Approximately 3 years after the onset of her symptoms, visual acuity, color testing, and visual fields have markedly improved with tumor regression by magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of spontaneous regression of an optic-nerve glioma should be considered even in the planning of treatment for a non-NF1 patient with this tumor.","['Hwang, Jeong-Min', 'Cheon, Jung-Eun', 'Wang, Kyu-Chang']","['Hwang JM', 'Cheon JE', 'Wang KC']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Sungnam, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,IM,,,,2008/01/05 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00381-007-0564-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2008 Jun;24(6):693-8. doi: 10.1007/s00381-007-0564-6.

AIMS: To study the prevalence of asthenopia among computer operators and its association with various epidemiological factors. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Community-based cross-sectional study of 419 subjects who work on computer for varying period of time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred forty computer operators working in different institutes were selected randomly. Twenty-one did not participate in the study, making the nonresponse rate 4.8%. Rest of the subjects (n = 419) were asked to fill a pre-tested questionnaire, after obtaining their verbal consent. Other relevant information was obtained by personal interview and inspection of workstation. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Simple proportions and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Among the 419 subjects studied, 194 (46.3%) suffered from asthenopia during or after work on computer. Marginally higher proportion of asthenopia was noted in females compared to males. Occurrence of asthenopia was significantly associated with age of starting use of computer, presence of refractive error, viewing distance, level of top of the computer screen with respect to eyes, use of antiglare screen and adjustment of contrast and brightness of monitor screen. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of asthenopia was noted to be quite high among computer operators, particularly in those who started its use at an early age.

In most of the developed countries, there are recommendations issued by renowned medical associations with regard to the definition, the diagnosis, and the methods for the prevention, treatment and periodical control of the symptoms found in computer users, in conjunction with an extremely detailed ergonomic legislation.

We have attempted to explain this and to identify an intervention that preserves binocular vision while maximizing perceptual stability. CASE REPORT AND METHODS: Eye movements were recorded and analyzed for duration of foveation (% time when the target was on or near the fovea and the eye was moving at < or = 4 degrees /sec) under different viewing conditions. Changes in foveation were compared with the patient's reports of her perceptual stability. RESULTS: In her right gaze null with her right eye fixating, foveation was 52.9%. This fell to 32.3% for the same eye in primary position and to 0.8% when viewing binocularly in primary position. When viewing binocularly oscillopsia was incessant; when viewing with her right eye vision was stable except in left gaze. Prism correction of her phoria greatly reduced her oscillopsia when viewing binocularly while preserving stereopsis; foveation went up to 33.7%. CONCLUSION: The patient's ability to maintain good foveation only when viewing with her right eye forces her to choose between stereopsis and stable vision. This may result from the rare combination of (1) requiring good foveation for oscillopsia suppression and (2) nystagmus deteriorating under the stress of maintaining binocularity. There may be many other infantile nystagmus syndrome patients who do not develop oscillopsia but may suffer sufficient asthenopia from a phoria to exacerbate their nystagmus.","['Abel, Larry A', 'Malesic, Linda A']","['Abel LA', 'Malesic LA']","['Department of Optometry and Vision Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. label@unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2007/11/29 09:00,2008/01/17 09:00,['2007/11/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/OPX.0b013e318159aa52 [doi]', '00006324-200711000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2007 Nov;84(11):1017-23. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e318159aa52.,,,20080116,,,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Convergence, Ocular', 'Depth Perception', 'Eye Movements', 'Female', 'Fixation, Ocular', 'Fovea Centralis/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Lenses', 'Nystagmus, Pathologic/*complications/epidemiology', 'Strabismus/physiopathology', 'Vision Disorders/*etiology', 'Vision, Binocular', 'Vision, Monocular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Using Mohs surgery as a model, we investigated the role of ergonomics in office-based surgery to limit work-related musculoskeletal disorders. METHODS: All Mayo Clinic surgeons currently performing Mohs surgery and Mohs surgeons trained at Mayo Clinic between 1990 and 2004 received a questionnaire survey between May 2003 and September 2004. A sample of respondents were videotaped during surgery. The main outcome measures were survey responses and an ergonomist's identification of potential causes of musculoskeletal disorders. RESULTS: All 17 surgeons surveyed responded. Those surveyed spend a mean of 24 hours per week in surgery. Sixteen said they had symptoms caused by or made worse by performing surgery. Symptom onset occurred on average at age 35.4 years. The most common complaints were pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and lower back and headaches. Videotapes of 6 surgeons revealed problems with operating room setup, awkward posture, forceful exertion, poor positioning, lighting, and duration of procedures. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of musculoskeletal injuries are common and may begin early in a physician's career. Modifying footwear, flooring, table height, operating position, lighting, and surgical instruments may improve the ergonomics of office-based surgery.","['Esser, Adam C', 'Koshy, James G', 'Randle, Henry W']","['Esser AC', 'Koshy JG', 'Randle HW']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dermatol Surg,Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],9504371,IM,,,,2007/10/26 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['DSU33281 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4725.2007.33281.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dermatol Surg. 2007 Nov;33(11):1304-13; discussion 1313-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4725.2007.33281.x.,,,20071129,,,"['Adult', '*Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', 'Asthenopia/prevention & control', 'Edema/prevention & control', 'Ergonomics/*methods', 'Female', 'Headache/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Low Back Pain/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Minnesota', 'Mohs Surgery/*methods', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Neck Pain/prevention & control', 'Occupational Diseases/*prevention & control', '*Physicians', ""Physicians' Offices"", 'Population Surveillance', 'Posture', 'Shoulder Pain/prevention & control', 'Videotape Recording']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It frequently involves foreign body or sandy sensation, blurring of vision, and fatigue, worsening especially at the end of the day. We undertook a study to determine the effectiveness of periocular isolation using microenvironment glasses (MEGS) alone and in combination with artificial tears in alleviating the symptoms and signs of dry eye related to computer use. At the same time, we evaluated the relative ability of a battery of clinical tests for dry eye to distinguish dry eyes from normal eyes in heavy computer users. Forty adult subjects who used computers 3 hours or more per day were divided into dry eye sufferers and controls based on their scores on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). Baseline scores were recorded and ocular surface assessments were made. On four subsequent visits, the subjects played a computer game for 30 minutes in a controlled environment, during which one of four treatment conditions were applied, in random order, to each subject: 1) no treatment, 2) artificial tears, 3) MEGS, and 4) artificial tears combined with MEGS. Immediately after each session, subjects were tested on: a subjective comfort questionnaire, tear breakup time (TBUT), fluorescein staining, lissamine green staining, and conjunctival injection. In this study, a significant correlation was found between cumulative lifetime computer use and ocular surface disorder, as measured by the standardized OSDI index. The experimental and control subjects were significantly different (P<0.05) in the meibomian gland assessment and TBUT; they were consistently different in fluorescein and lissamine green staining, but with P>0.05. Isolation of the ocular surface alone produced significant improvements in comfort scores and TBUT and a consistent trend of improvement in fluorescein staining and lissamine green staining. Isolation plus tears produced a significant improvement in lissamine green staining. The subjective comfort inventory and the TBUT test were most effective in distinguishing between the treatments used. Computer users with ocular surface complaints should have a detailed ocular surface examination and, if symptomatic, they can be effectively treated with isolation of the ocular surface, artificial tears therapy, and effective environmental manipulations.","['Yee, Richard W', 'Sperling, Harry G', 'Kattek, Ashballa', 'Paukert, Martin T', 'Dawson, Kevin', 'Garcia, Marcie', 'Hilsenbeck, Susan']","['Yee RW', 'Sperling HG', 'Kattek A', 'Paukert MT', 'Dawson K', 'Garcia M', 'Hilsenbeck S']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Hermann Eye Center, Cizik Eye Center, and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.

METHODS: The OCI was self-completed by 452 subjects. Some of them repeated the questionnaire, to aid in determining its reliability and test-retest repeatability. Ten versions were produced to evaluate question order effects. In addition, three construct hypotheses were tested to verify that the OCI was measuring what was intended, concordance with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), the relationship with tear break-up time (TBUT), and the change in TBUT after the use of ocular lubricants in individuals with moderate dry eye. RESULTS: A 12-item OCI was developed with well-functioning items and categories: 95% confidence interval for the intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.81 to 0.91; person separation = 2.66; item separation = 11.12; and 95% repeatability coefficient = 13.1 units (0-100 scale). The ordering of items had no effect on OCI measures (P = 0.41). The OCI measure exhibited a positive correlation with the OSDI score (P < 0.0001) and a negative correlation with TBUT (P < 0.0001) and was able to detect improvement in symptoms of dry eye in individuals before and after treatment (P < 0.0001).

METHODS: Based on focus group studies, involving people with glaucoma, existing profile measures relevant to glaucoma were modified and a six-dimensional profile instrument was developed. Dimensions were: central and near vision; lighting and glare; mobility; activities of daily living; eye discomfort and other effects. Each dimension was assigned four levels (no difficulty; some difficulty; quite a lot of difficulty; and severe difficulty). The discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach was employed to move from this profile instrument to a preference-based utility measure. Experimental design techniques were used to derive a sample of health states for which preferences were elicited using the DCE. Four hundred and seventy-three people with glaucoma received the choice questionnaire. RESULTS: The regression analysis was based on 286 consistent responses to the DCE. The regression coefficients for three of the dimensions (""central and near vision,"" ""mobility,"" and ""activities of daily living"") moved as expected. Moving from ""no difficulty"" to ""severe difficulty"" for central and near vision resulted in the most loss of utility, followed by activities of daily living and mobility. Systemic (""other effects"") and local side effects were considered the least important. Utility weights were related to self-reported glaucoma state. Utility estimates moved in line with generic measures of health outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a preference-based utility measure (Glaucoma Utility Index) using the DCE approach. The index, estimated on the basis of 286 respondents, demonstrated both theoretical and convergent validity with other generic health outcome measures and measures of glaucoma severity. Further research investigating preferences by clinically defined glaucoma health status is indicated. Methodological research should focus on alternative methods of scaling for use within a generic Quality Adjusted Life Year framework.","['Burr, Jennifer M', 'Kilonzo, Mary', 'Vale, Luke', 'Ryan, Mandy']","['Burr JM', 'Kilonzo M', 'Vale L', 'Ryan M']","['Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom. j.m.burr@abdn.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/OPX.0b013e3181339f30 [doi]', '00006324-200708000-00020 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2007 Aug;84(8):797-808. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e3181339f30.,,,20071016,,,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/etiology', 'Choice Behavior', 'Female', 'Glaucoma/complications/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Movement', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Regression Analysis', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Surveys and Questionnaires/standards', 'Visual Acuity']",,"['HERU1/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'HERU2/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'HSRU1/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the questionnaire does not meet some psychometric quality criteria. The objectives of this study were first to obtain the factor structure of the VFQ-25, and second, to obtain interval scales by Rasch analysis. METHODS: The questionnaire was administered to 129 visually impaired adults (mean age 42.1 years; range 21 to 67 years). First, the items of the VFQ-25 were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis with Promax rotation. Next, we performed a separate Rasch analysis on each factor. We examined step thresholds and goodness of fit statistics of the items. Finally, we examined differential item functioning. RESULTS: Factor analysis indicated four factors: Near Activities, Distance Activities and Mobility, Mental Health and Dependency, and Pain and Discomfort. They accounted for 46.37% of the total variance. Most items showed some degree of disordering. After collapsing response categories, all items showed ordered thresholds. The Near Activities domain showed excellent fit, whereas the Distance Activities and Mobility domain, the Mental Health and Dependency domain, and the Pain and Discomfort domain had an unsatisfactory fit. There were two items showing uniform differential item functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The four-factor structure of the VFQ-25 largely confirms the structure of the questionnaire.

METHODS: Members of the research team administered a survey of visual discomfort developed by Conlon et al. (Conlon et al., Vis Cogn 1999;6:637-666) to 571 college students at the Claremont Colleges University over a 2-year period. The survey for measuring visual discomfort developed by Conlon consists of 23 items with a four-point scale (0 to 3) (see below). Scores on the survey can range from 0 to 69. RESULTS: A Rasch analysis of the survey results showed that a single symptom dimension accounted for 73.5% of the variance. A principle component analysis of the residual variance from the Rasch analysis yielded three factors: factor 1 was associated with text movement and fading; factor 2 was associated with headache and soreness; and factor 3 was associated primarily with blur and diplopia. CONCLUSIONS: The survey developed by Conlon is an appropriate measure of visual discomfort. In addition to the single dimension reported by Conlon, we found that some subjects with moderate to high amounts of visual discomfort tended to report particular types of symptoms.

Blink-free epochs of EMG data were analyzed for power for all the conditions. Blink rate for all the trials was also measured. At the end of each trial, subjects rated the severity of visual discomfort experienced while reading. RESULTS: Conditions that benefit from squint (refractive error and glare) showed increased EMG power (p < 0.001) from the orbicularis and increased blink rate (p = 0.002), whereas those that do not benefit from squint (small font and low contrast) showed no significant EMG response and a significant decrease in blink rate (p = 0.003 and p = 0.01). All conditions resulted in significant visual discomfort; the p value for font type was 0.039 and p < 0.001 for the other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the squint-beneficial conditions are operated by a local mechanism involving contraction of the orbicularis and increase in reflex blinking, whereas those that do not benefit from squint do not engage the orbicularis and decrease blink, possibly through central inhibition of spontaneous blinking. The EMG response is a sensitive objective measure for the squint-beneficial conditions. However, for the non-squint-beneficial conditions, blink rate may be a more sensitive objective measure, although EMG with longer trial durations should be tested.","['Nahar, Niru K', 'Sheedy, James E', 'Hayes, John', 'Tai, Yu-Chi']","['Nahar NK', 'Sheedy JE', 'Hayes J', 'Tai YC']","['College of Optometry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. nahar.2@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2007/07/17 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/07/17 09:00'],"['2007/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/OPX.0b013e3180dc99a8 [doi]', '00006324-200707000-00019 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2007 Jul;84(7):620-9. doi: 10.1097/OPX.0b013e3180dc99a8.,,,20070911,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Blinking/*physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Electromyography', 'Eyelids/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Oculomotor Muscles/*physiopathology', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Values', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty subjects (18-36 years) screened for 20/20 vision in each eye participated in the study. Subjects read passages under different asthenopia-inducing conditions. The inducing conditions were glare, low contrast, small font size, refractive error, up gaze, accommodative stress and convergence stress. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to study the orbicularis oculi response from the right eye. Palpebral fissure height was measured from recorded video images of the right eye. At the end of each condition subjects were asked to rate the severity and type of visual discomfort experienced. RESULTS: Outcome measures for the asthenopia-inducing conditions were compared with their respective nonstress controls. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. Refractive error (p = 0.0001), glare (p = 0.0001), low contrast (p = 0.007), small font (p = 0.034), and up gaze (p = 0.001) resulted in a significant increase in EMG power. Refractive error (p = 0.0001) and glare (p = 0.0001) also caused significant reduction in aperture size. Reading a low contrast text caused a reduction in blink rate (p = 0.035), whereas refractive error (p = 0.005) and glare (p = 0.01) caused an increase in blink rate. All conditions induced significant visual discomfort (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Refractive error and glare, which reduce image quality and benefit from eyelid squint, caused increased EMG power, eyelid squint response and increased blink rate. Low contrast and small font, which reduce image quality but do not benefit from eyelid squint, resulted in increased EMG power without changes in aperture size and reduced blink rate (for low contrast). Accommodative and convergence stress (in subjects with normal accommodative and vergence abilities) did not cause changes in EMG power, aperture size or blink rate. These results suggest that contraction of the orbicularis oculi is a part of the asthenopia mechanism related to compromised image quality.","['Gowrisankaran, Sowjanya', 'Sheedy, James E', 'Hayes, John R']","['Gowrisankaran S', 'Sheedy JE', 'Hayes JR']","['The Ohio State University College of Optometry, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A random KAP survey was carried out on 300 Indian ophthalmologists using a 34-point spot-questionnaire in January 2005. RESULTS: All the doctors who responded were aware of CVS. The chief presenting symptoms were eyestrain (97.8%), headache (82.1%), tiredness and burning sensation (79.1%), watering (66.4%) and redness (61.2%). Ophthalmologists using computers reported that focusing from distance to near and vice versa (P =0.006, chi2 test), blurred vision at a distance (P =0.016, chi2 test) and blepharospasm (P =0.026, chi2 test) formed part of the syndrome. The main mode of treatment used was tear substitutes. Half of ophthalmologists (50.7%) were not prescribing any spectacles. They did not have any preference for any special type of glasses (68.7%) or spectral filters. Computer-users were more likely to prescribe sedatives/anxiolytics (P = 0.04, chi2 test), spectacles (P = 0.02, chi2 test) and conscious frequent blinking (P = 0.003, chi2 test) than the non-computer-users. CONCLUSIONS: All respondents were aware of CVS. Confusion regarding treatment guidelines was observed in both groups. Computer-using ophthalmologists were more informed of symptoms and diagnostic signs but were misinformed about treatment modalities.","['Bali, Jatinder', 'Navin, Neeraj', 'Thakur, Bali Renu']","['Bali J', 'Navin N', 'Thakur BR']","['TNC Hospital, Tilaknagar, Delhi - 110 085, India. drjatinderbali@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Ophthalmol,Indian journal of ophthalmology,0405376,IM,,,,2007/06/28 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/06/28 09:00'],"['2007/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4103/0301-4738.33042 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Ophthalmol. 2007 Jul-Aug;55(4):289-94. doi: 10.4103/0301-4738.33042.,,,20070911,,['Indian J Ophthalmol. 2008 Mar-Apr;56(2):171.

Threshold CS was assessed using the von Bekesy tracking method from a viewing distance of 2.4 m (0.40 D). Three counterbalanced tasks required central fixation of black-and-white square-wave gratings (1, 5, 10, 14 and 17 c/deg) presented through a low-pass filter blue lens and (1) a +1.50 D lens; (2) a -1.50 D lens and (3) a 0 D lens, while attempting accommodation to minimize blur. Baseline increases in eye strain, which approached high levels at the end of the experiment, did not differentiate between the two groups of volunteers. All the subjects made evident appropriate accommodation during the low blur condition (0 D); the CS curve exhibited the expected characteristics. When the minus lens was placed before the eyes of the observers the distant square-wave gratings were still seen clearly, the eyes presumably had accommodated by an amount equal to the power of the negative lens. Compared with symptom-free subjects, asthenopics exhibited greater CS at the intermediate spatial frequencies both during the low blur and the minus blur conditions. Asthenopics may exhibit an individualized sensory tendency to react more strongly to shorter wavelengths of light and may therefore reflexively 'drive' their accommodative system harder than symptom-free subjects. This would explain the presence of their asthenopia in the first place. Blue light may, in addition, induce more arousal and higher alertness in this category of participants. This would boost the oculomotor aspects of their performance. These findings add to the current understanding of individual variability in the level of oculomotor loads following strenuous near work.","['Richter, H O', 'Knez, I']","['Richter HO', 'Knez I']","['Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Education and Psychology, University of Gavle, SE-801 76 Gavle, Sweden. hrr@hig.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2007/06/23 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/06/23 09:00'],"['2007/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['OPO494 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1475-1313.2007.00494.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2007 Jul;27(4):361-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2007.00494.x.,,,20070927,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adaptation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Contrast Sensitivity/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Male', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All workers spent 4 weeks with conventional breaks (two 15 min breaks per day) and 4 weeks with supplementary breaks (two 15 min breaks plus four 5 min breaks per day). One-half were assigned at random to a group instructed to perform brief stretching exercises during breaks. The remainder comprised the ""no stretching"" (control) group. RESULTS: 51 workers (stretch group n = 21; no stretch group n = 30) completed the study symptom questionnaires. Discomfort and eyestrain were significantly lower with supplementary breaks, and supplementary breaks attenuated accumulation of discomfort and eyestrain during work sessions. Data-entry speed was significantly faster with supplementary breaks so that work output was maintained, despite replacing 20 min of work time with break time. In the stretch group, workers reported stretching during only 25% of conventional breaks and 39% of supplementary breaks, and no significant effects of stretching on discomfort or performance were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further converging evidence that supplementary breaks reliably minimize discomfort and eyestrain without impairing productivity. Low compliance in performing stretches prevented valid assessment of stretching effects. Further research on stretching exercises and exercise compliance is warranted.","['Galinsky, Traci', 'Swanson, Naomi', 'Sauter, Steven', 'Dunkin, Robin', 'Hurrell, Joseph', 'Schleifer, Lawrence']","['Galinsky T', 'Swanson N', 'Sauter S', 'Dunkin R', 'Hurrell J', 'Schleifer L']","['National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. tgalinsky@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,,,,2007/05/22 09:00,2007/08/11 09:00,['2007/05/22 09:00'],"['2007/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.20472 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2007 Jul;50(7):519-27. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20472.,,,20070810,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology/*prevention & control', '*Computer Terminals', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control', '*Personnel Staffing and Scheduling', '*Rest', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their use, however, may increase the risk of developing adverse conditions related to vision, the musculoskeletal system, and mental health. We carried out a survey among 3070 workers aged 18 to 67 years (mean, 39.9 years) at a prefectural administrative office, in which 76% of subjects were visual display terminal (VDT) users. We examined the relationship between duration of daily VDT use and eyestrain, neck or upper extremity pain, back pain, and mental health, and estimated the effect of breaks and rest during VDT work on these symptoms. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12: total scores ranged from 0 to 12) was used to identify potential poor mental health status, and subjects with 4 or more were considered to have symptoms of psychological distress. Seventeen percent of subjects reported eyestrain, 19.1% reported upper extremity pain, 11.6% reported back pain, and 17% of subjects had GHQ-12 scores of 4 or higher.

In order to protect users from the adverse effects associated with VDT work, reducing daily VDT exposure, taking breaks, and rest during VDT work are important.","['Ye, Zhaojia', 'Abe, Yasuyo', 'Kusano, Yosuke', 'Takamura, Noboru', 'Eida, Kazuyuki', 'Takemoto, Tai-ichiro', 'Aoyagi, Kiyoshi']","['Ye Z', 'Abe Y', 'Kusano Y', 'Takamura N', 'Eida K', 'Takemoto T', 'Aoyagi K']","['Department of Public Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Physiol Anthropol,Journal of physiological anthropology,101269653,IM,,,,2007/04/17 09:00,2007/05/19 09:00,['2007/04/17 09:00'],"['2007/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jpa2/26.69 [pii]', '10.2114/jpa2.26.69 [doi]']",ppublish,J Physiol Anthropol. 2007 Mar;26(2):69-73. doi: 10.2114/jpa2.26.69.,,,20070518,,,"['Administrative Personnel', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/etiology/psychology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Ergonomics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/etiology/psychology', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/etiology/psychology', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Workplace']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three hundred eyes of 150 children with hyperopia who did not have anisometropia > or =1.5 D were selected. Complete ophthalmological examination was performed for all children. Hyperopia was defined when spherical equivalent was +0.5 D or greater. Amblyopia was screened and treated by patching therapy and then penalisation. Complete spectacle correction was achieved in children with high hyperopia (+3.5 D or greater) or in presence of squint or amblyopia. A statistical analysis compared the results using the Mann-Whitney test and the chi square test. RESULTS: The mean age was 9.5+/-2.7 years. Girls were statistically more represented than boys. The mean sphere measured overall was +2 D (+/-1.65). Severe hyperopia was detected in 19% of the children; it was latent in 35% of children. Strabismus was detected in 7% and was accommodative in 25%. Esotropia was the most prevalent deviation (72.8%). The prevalence of amblyopia was 12%. The mean sphere measured in amblyopic children was 5.66 D (+/-1.64 D). Initial depth of amblyopia was mild to moderate and 98% of the children achieved iso-acuity after patching therapy. The correlation between severe hyperopia, amblyopia, and squint was statistically significant. Indeed, the risk ratios of squint and amblyopia, 5.2 and 3.70, respectively, were significantly high in children with severe hypermetropia. Complete spectacle correction improved final visual acuity and reduced the angle deviation in accommodative esotropia. CONCLUSION: Children with hyperopia of +3.5 D or greater have an increased risk of amblyopia and squint that threatens their visual function. Hyperopic correction should be prescribed even if no strabismus or amblyopia is detected in order to prevent this risk. Screening programs should also be promoted to detect these children at an early age.","['Jeddi Blouza, A', 'Loukil, I', 'Mhenni, A', 'Khayati, L', 'Mallouche, N', 'Zouari, B']","['Jeddi Blouza A', 'Loukil I', 'Mhenni A', 'Khayati L', 'Mallouche N', 'Zouari B']","[""Service d'Ophtalmologie, Hopital La Rabta, Tunis, Tunisie.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,J Fr Ophtalmol,Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,7804128,IM,,,,2007/04/10 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/04/10 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0181-5512(07)89587-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0181-5512(07)89587-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Fr Ophtalmol. 2007 Mar;30(3):255-9. doi: 10.1016/s0181-5512(07)89587-8.,,,20070501,,,"['Adolescent', 'Amblyopia/etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Asthenopia/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Esotropia/etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Headache/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hyperopia/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Occlusive Dressings', 'Prevalence', 'Strabismus/etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,Prise en charge de l'hypermetropie de l'enfant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last ten years a number of studies have shown that ocular symptoms are the form of discomfort most frequently experienced by subjects who work at VDT. The symptoms as a whole characterize a complex syndrome named ""asthenopia"" and have been seen as a consequence of prolonged, fixed and closely oriented vision. In our study we have evaluated data derived from a standardized questionnaire (a series of questions elaborated and promoted by the Italian Society of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene). It was administered to a group of 191 workers who utilise VDT for more than 20 hours each week. We also took into consideration the results of ophthalmologic medical examinations performed on this particular group of workers. Prevalence of occupational asthenopia we found to be lower in this group than in the case of other reported investigations, though it proved to be higher in the case of female subjects. According to the Literature, symptoms intensity is related to the duration of weekly VDT use, there being no significant association with the number of years spent working at VDT. Our results show that prevalence of asthenopia was not significantly influenced by refractive alterations and this unexpected outcome might be explained by taking into account the small-size group of subjects affected by hypermetropic defects. It is well known that these are the most important factors in conditioning asthenopia. Our finding indicates the need for further research, which should include a larger group of VDT workers with refractive alterations and furthermore take into consideration environmental variables such as climate and illumination, since these are co-aetiological factors, known or suspected, of occupational asthenopia.","['Taino, G', 'Ferrari, M', 'Mestad, I J', 'Fabris, F', 'Imbriani, M']","['Taino G', 'Ferrari M', 'Mestad IJ', 'Fabris F', 'Imbriani M']","['IRCCS Fondazione S.

Visual acuity, among the visual functions, is the most important factor. Decreased far vision is caused mainly by refractive errors, while decreased near vision is caused by accommodative insufficiency, especially presbyopia. REFRACTIVE ERRORS: The development of myopia may be influenced by both polygenic and environmental factors. Investigation of the mechanism of myopia has progressed based on the experimental animal models of myopia. The conventional treatments for refractive errors is spectacles or contact lenses, and new treatment includes phakic IOL, orthokeratology, and refractive surgery. There are also newly designed types of equipment to assess refraction and refractive elements. ACCOMMODATIVE INSUFFICIENCY: Presbyopia is mainly corrected using multifocal or progressive power spectacle lenses. Nowadays, bifocal and multifocal contact lenses and sometimes surgical treatment are used for presbyopia. Equipment for asthenopia has also been developed.","['Tokoro, Takashi']",['Tokoro T'],"['Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama, Japan. tokoro_t@ba3.so-net.ne.jp']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,,,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2007 Feb;111(2):77-82.,,,20070403,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Animals', 'Contact Lenses', 'Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological/instrumentation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Humans', 'Keratomileusis, Laser In Situ', 'Lens Implantation, Intraocular', '*Presbyopia/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', '*Refractive Errors/classification/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Vision, Ocular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,43,

METHODS: Forty generally healthy adults, aged between 24 and 44 years, were asked to complete a 13 page questionnaire that included requests for information on general visual symptoms, headache and specific ocular symptoms such as dry eye associated with VDT use. The adults were either long term successful soft contact lens wearers (n=20) or a similar group who had then undergone successful LASIK refractive surgery for myopia 2 years prior to the questionnaire being provided. RESULTS: Most subjects (70%) reported experiencing some visual symptoms sometimes, 62.5% reported headaches sometimes, and 82.5 % reported specific ocular symptoms sometimes. There were no obvious differences between the two groups either in the reported frequency or severity (by visual analogue scale, VAS) of visual symptoms, headache or specific ocular symptoms. However, while the reporting of headache showed no obvious association with the number of specific ocular symptoms reported, the latter showed a clear correlation with the reporting of the severity of visual symptoms (p<0.001). DISCUSSION: The results indicate that when an individual reports visual symptoms, they may actually be providing recall of specific ocular symptoms. Therefore, contrary to an often common practice, visual symptoms should be assessed separately to specific ocular symptoms such that the appropriate management can be selected. The results also indicate that previous contact lens wearers who have undergone successful LASIK are still likely to experience some visual and specific ocular symptoms when undertaking computer based work on a regular basis.","['Aakre, Bente Monica', 'Doughty, Michael J']","['Aakre BM', 'Doughty MJ']","['Buskerud University College, Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Frogsvei 41, 3611 Kongsberg, Norway.

The authors investigated how this ""second-eye effect"" evolves over time and studied systematic changes in threshold in the first eye. METHODS: Thresholds were measured in four subjects for 5 degrees -square, 0.5-cyc/deg sine wave gratings counterphase-flickered at 18 Hz, using a ""method of a thousand staircases"" to track changes in thresholds at 10-second intervals. Stimuli appeared in 1 of 5 interleaved horizontal locations. Subjects adapted binocularly (background, 45 cd/m(2)) for 5 minutes before performing a 5-minute test with one eye (the ""first eye"") followed immediately by the other (the ""second eye""). These results were compared with baseline monocular thresholds measured over 3.5 minutes according to a conventional staircase procedure. In addition, two subjects repeated the main experiment with a translucent, rather than opaque, patch. RESULTS: On average, second-eye thresholds were raised by 6 dB (0.3 log) at the beginning of the test and were reduced to 4 dB toward the end. Little change was observed in the magnitude of the second-eye effect as a function of eccentricity. A significant ""first-eye effect"" was also observed in which thresholds increased by approximately 2 dB as the first-eye test progressed. Translucent patching largely abolished first- and second-eye effects, indicating neither was the result of fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Steady adaptation in both eyes is important for obtaining stable perimetric thresholds. Unless appropriate tests are performed, the effects of adaptation could easily be mistaken for those of fatigue.","['Anderson, Andrew John', 'McKendrick, Allison Maree']","['Anderson AJ', 'McKendrick AM']","['Department of Optometry and Vision Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. aaj@unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,IM,,,,2007/01/26 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2007/01/26 09:00'],"['2007/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['48/2/943 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.06-0685 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2007 Feb;48(2):943-8. doi: 10.1167/iovs.06-0685.,,,20070301,,,"['Adaptation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensory Thresholds/physiology', '*Visual Field Tests', 'Visual Fields']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-nine children (mean age 10.2 years +/- 2.7) diagnosed with AI graded their degree of asthenopia on the VAS before and after a 12-week treatment period wearing individually dispensed reading glasses. RESULTS: The improvement in accommodation after treatment was statistically significant (p < 0.001) and 83.7% of the children obtained normal accommodative amplitude in relation to age. The reduction in asthenopic symptoms as graded with the VAS was also statistically significant (p < 0.001) after treatment and 89.9% of the children obtained a normal VAS score. However, no correlation between the degree of accommodative deficiency and the VAS grading could be found, neither before nor after treatment. DISCUSSION: Based on these results we conclude that the visual analogue scale (VAS) cannot be used as an instrument to indicate the degree of accommodative deficiency nor can it be used to indicate the level of improvement during the course of treatment. However, the VAS can be used as an instrument to verify and document whether or not asthenopic symptoms are present, and therefore also to indicate when symptoms have been relieved.","['Abdi, S', 'Rydberg, A', 'Pansell, T', 'Brautaset, R']","['Abdi S', 'Rydberg A', 'Pansell T', 'Brautaset R']","[""St. Erik's Eye Hospital, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. saber.abdi@ste.ki.se""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Strabismus,Strabismus,9310896,IM,,,,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['NGQ8W3K571345771 [pii]', '10.1080/09273970601026110 [doi]']",ppublish,Strabismus. 2006 Dec;14(4):199-204. doi: 10.1080/09273970601026110.,,,20070322,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Child', 'Eyeglasses', 'Humans', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Pain Measurement/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy-eight patients met the inclusion criteria of visual acuity 6/9 or better, no history of orthoptic treatment, squint surgery or Meares Irlen syndrome/dyslexia. Information was collected from case records related to diagnosis, near point of convergence, fusion range, prism and cover test measurements and symptoms. Type, duration and frequency of exercises were also recorded. Non-parametric statistics were applied. RESULTS: Patients ranged in age from 5 to 73 years (mean 11.9). Females outnumbered males (46:32). The diagnoses were: decompensating heterophoria (n = 50) or convergence insufficiency (n = 28: primary 27; secondary 1). Exophoria was more common (n = 65), than esophoria (n = 11) or orthophoria (n = 1). Treatments were aimed at improving near point of convergence and/or reduced fusional reserves. The mean treatment period was 8.2 months. Reduced near point of convergence normalized following treatment in 47/55 cases, and mean near point of convergence improved from 16.6 to 8.4 cm (p = 0.0001). Fusional reserves normalized in 29/50. Fusional convergence improved significantly for those with exodeviation (p > 0.0006). Asthenopic symptoms improved in 65 patients. A reduction in deviation of 5 pd or more occurred in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Orthoptic exercises are an effective means of reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating exophoria, and appear to target the proximal and fusional components of convergence. Their role in esophoria is unclear and needs further study.","['Aziz, S', 'Cleary, M', 'Stewart, H K', 'Weir, C R']","['Aziz S', 'Cleary M', 'Stewart HK', 'Weir CR']","['Tennent Institute of Ophthalmology, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, UK. samiraziz@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Strabismus,Strabismus,9310896,IM,,,,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['N1HM08U247360002 [pii]', '10.1080/09273970601026185 [doi]']",ppublish,Strabismus. 2006 Dec;14(4):183-9. doi: 10.1080/09273970601026185.,,,20070322,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Convergence, Ocular', 'Exercise Therapy/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/*therapy', 'Orthoptics/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Strabismus/*therapy', '*Vision Disparity', 'Vision, Binocular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: A structured translation process was followed to generate the ASQE, a 26-item instrument (originally in Dutch) containing five subscales for fear of losing the better eye, distance estimation, visual disorientation, double vision, and social contact and appearance. The ASQE was administered to 150 adults in a private practice setting. All had strabismus with or without amblyopia and visual acuity of 20/50 or better in at least one eye. Subjects also completed a brief disability questionnaire, and they were further characterized by levels of unilateral vision loss, diplopia, and asthenopia. RESULTS: ASQE scores were highly correlated with the disability questionnaire outcomes (r = -.76, P < .0001). Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha) of the subscales ranged from 0.80 to 0.92. Strong correlations were found between clinical characteristics and the ASQE (total score and subscale scores). CONCLUSIONS: The ASQE showed good psychometric properties that are in line with those of the original instrument.

In the United States, testing has primarily followed a motor approach, and resulting management has followed parameters established by graphical analysis closely. In German-speaking countries, a strong sensory-based analysis has been popular for decades, utilizing equipment rarely seen in the United States. Management in these countries has been almost exclusively directed toward prismatic prescription. METHODS: This report examines the instrumentation, underlying strategies, and management used in both the motor and sensory approaches to fixation disparity analysis. Testing protocols and management options are detailed for each approach. CONCLUSION: Although both approaches agree that fixation disparity has the potential to reveal a more realistic view of binocular system functioning under normal viewing conditions than other systems of analysis, the approaches diverge in some very important ways, particularly in the understanding of the development of fixation disparity and its management. Whereas the philosophy underlying testing and management of the motor-based approach will be familiar to most clinicians in the United States, the sensory approach offers a very different perspective. It views the development of fixation disparity as a shift of correspondence within Panum's area. In effect, this may be thought of as the oxymoron ""a normal, anomalous correspondence""; that is, a shift of correspondence occurring in nonstrabismic patients. Management in these cases is based on accurate prism prescription to re-establish bifoveal fusion.","['London, Richard', 'Crelier, Roger S']","['London R', 'Crelier RS']","['Pacific University College of Optometry, 2043 College Way, Forest Grove, OR 97116, USA. londonr@pacificu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Optometry,"Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)",100912421,IM,,,,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/02/16 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1529-1839(06)00646-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.optm.2006.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Optometry. 2006 Dec;77(12):590-608. doi: 10.1016/j.optm.2006.09.006.,,,20070215,,,"['Asthenopia/diagnosis/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Eyeglasses', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Vision Disparity/*physiology', 'Vision Tests', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,107,

METHODS: Fifteen patients with simple MGD and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited in an initial prospective interventional clinical trial to evaluate the safety and short-term effects of the warm moist air device. The device was applied to the eyes of the subjects for 10 minutes. Temperatures of the eye lids and corneas were measured with an infrared thermometer. Symptoms of ocular fatigue were scored using visual analog scales (VASs). Schirmer test, tear film break-up time (BUT), DR-1 tear film lipid layer interferometry, fluorescein staining, and rose bengal staining were also performed before and after the application of the eye steamer. After the initial study, another 2-week prospective clinical trial was carried out in 10 patients with MGD who received the warm moist air treatment. Ten other patients were also recruited and received warm compress treatment with hot towels for 2 weeks to evaluate the long-term effects of the warm moist air device and the warm compresses on tear film lipid layer thickness and ocular surface health. The warm moist air device and the warm compresses were applied for 10 minutes twice a day. The changes in VAS scores for symptoms, BUT values, fluorescein, and rose bengal staining scores were examined before and after each treatment during the second trial. RESULTS: VAS scores of ocular fatigue improved significantly with short- and long-term applications of the warm moist air device in both studies. The mean corneal surface and eye lid temperatures showed significant elevation within safe limits 10 minutes after the moist air application. The mean BUT prolonged significantly in the patients receiving warm moist air applications but did not change significantly in those treated with warm compresses. DR-1 tear film lipid layer interference showed evidence of lipid expression in the patients and controls, with thickening of the tear film lipid layer after 10 minutes of warm moist air device use. In the 2-week trial, tear film lipid layer thickness increased in both warm moist air device and warm compress groups, with a greater extent of increase in the warm moist air device group. CONCLUSION: Warm moist air device use provided symptomatic relief of ocular fatigue and improvement of tear stability in patients with MGD. The new warm moist air device seems to be a safe and promising alternative in the treatment of MGD.","['Matsumoto, Yukihiro', 'Dogru, Murat', 'Goto, Eiki', 'Ishida, Reiko', 'Kojima, Takashi', 'Onguchi, Tatsuya', 'Yagi, Yukiko', 'Shimazaki, Jun', 'Tsubota, Kazuo']","['Matsumoto Y', 'Dogru M', 'Goto E', 'Ishida R', 'Kojima T', 'Onguchi T', 'Yagi Y', 'Shimazaki J', 'Tsubota K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Tokyo Dental College, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cornea,Cornea,8216186,IM,,,,2006/11/02 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.ico.0000208822.70732.25 [doi]', '00003226-200607000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Cornea. 2006 Jul;25(6):644-50. doi: 10.1097/01.ico.0000208822.70732.25.,,,20070524,['0 (Steam)'],,"['Aged', 'Asthenopia/*therapy', 'Body Temperature', 'Eyelid Diseases/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Humidity', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Interferometry', 'Lipid Metabolism/physiology', 'Male', '*Meibomian Glands', 'Middle Aged', 'Ophthalmology/*instrumentation', 'Prospective Studies', '*Steam', 'Tears/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Time tradeoff utility values were measured in physician-conducted interviews with 140 adult patients with strabismus in a private practice setting. Patients also completed a questionnaire containing six items that rated the following aspects of disability: specific health problems, problems with tasks of daily living, problems with social interaction, self-image problems, concerns about the future, and job-related problems. Patients were characterized as presurgical or nonsurgical, and their diplopia and asthenopia were rated by the physician on a four-level scale. RESULTS: About 60% of all patients indicated willingness to trade part of their life expectancy in return for being rid of strabismus and its associated effects. The median utility was 0.93 (interquartile range, 0.83 to 1.0). A significantly smaller proportion (44%) of the nonsurgical patients (N = 41) appeared willing to trade time compared with surgical patients (68%; P = .009). Median utility in the presurgical patients was 0.90. Strong relationships were found between utility and the level of diplopia (P < .0001), and between utility and the level of asthenopia (P < .0001). Utility was correlated with all six disability ratings (all P < or = .00062). CONCLUSION: A majority of the patients interviewed would trade a portion of their life expectancy in return for being rid of strabismus and its associated effects. These results were validated by significant associations with diplopia, asthenopia, and disability.","['Beauchamp, George R', 'Felius, Joost', 'Stager, David R', 'Beauchamp, Cynthia L']","['Beauchamp GR', 'Felius J', 'Stager DR', 'Beauchamp CL']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc,Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society,7506106,IM,,,,2006/10/24 09:00,2006/12/27 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc. 2005;103:164-71; discussion 171-2.,,,20061226,,,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anxiety', 'Asthenopia/etiology/physiopathology', '*Cost of Illness', 'Diplopia/etiology/physiopathology', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Interviews as Topic', '*Longevity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', '*Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Self Concept', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Strabismus/complications/*physiopathology/*surgery', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC1447571,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had normal contrast sensitivity and normal dark adaptation. METHODS: The patients underwent ERG (including the standard protocol and photopic long flash recordings). RESULTS: The amplitudes of the rod ERG b-wave were reduced. The scotopic standard combined ERG response showed negative configuration. The photopic response to long flash revealed the reduced b-wave (ON response), while the amplitude of the first peak of the d-wave (OFF response) was within the normal range.

The aim of our study was to determine when prismatic corrections improve performance at a measure of dynamic visual function: the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (WRRT). All participants manifested an aligning prism (associated heterophoria) on the near Mallett Unit of 0.5Delta or greater. There were 80 participants, of whom 58 had exophoria, 15 esophoria, and seven hyperphoria. The effect of the aligning prism on the WRRT was compared with a control lens using a double-masked randomised design. For exophoria, an aligning prism of 2Delta and above has a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 79% for improving performance at the WRRT by 5% or more. It is not possible from our data to achieve a good compromise between sensitivity and specificity for the other types of heterophoria. Patients in the horizontal (but not vertical) heterophoria groups had significantly more symptoms than a control group. The patients whose visual performance is improved by prismatic correction are not necessarily those who report the most symptoms. Our data suggest that exophoric patients of any age are likely to have improved visual performance with an intervention if they have an aligning prism of 2Delta or more, even in the absence of symptoms. We stress that although the Mallett Unit Fixation Disparity test provides useful information, its results need to be considered in the overall context of the patient's symptoms, lifestyle, and the results of other optometric tests. Although this study evaluated prismatic corrections, we note that interventions for decompensated heterophoria include not only prismatic corrections, but also eye exercises and refractive modification.","[""O'Leary, Claire I"", 'Evans, Bruce J W']","[""O'Leary CI"", 'Evans BJ']","['Cole Martin Tregaskis Optometrists, 23 Shenfield Road, Brentwood, Essex, CM15 8AG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2006/10/17 09:00,2007/05/30 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['OPO400 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1475-1313.2006.00400.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2006 Nov;26(6):555-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2006.00400.x.,,,20070529,,,"['*Adaptation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia', 'Eyeglasses', '*Fixation, Ocular', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Reading', 'Vision Disorders/*rehabilitation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency and predictors of the psycho-emotional stress experienced at sea by Lithuanian and Latvian seamen. Beside the common statistical methods, the logistic stepwise regression analysis was used in order to find the risk factors of the self-rated stress and to correct the risk estimates for the confounding variables. Seamen of both countries indicated that they experienced psycho-emotional stress after, on the average, 2.7-2.8 months from the beginning of the voyage. More than one-half (57.5%) of Latvian seamen stated that they had experienced psycho-emotional stress, whereas the respective percentage of Lithuanian seamen was smaller (46.1%). The obtained findings showed that, having evaluated the influence of all the analyzed factors (industry-specific, health and lifestyle, medical and demographic), there was no significant difference between the seamen of the two countries concerning the experience of psycho-emotional stress on the ship. The following main prognostic factors related to the occurrence of psycho-emotional stress on the ship were determined: higher or specialized secondary education level (p<0.001), age of 35-44 or 45-54 years (p<0.01), 9-10 or 11-12 hours of work per day when being exposed to detrimental factors (p<0.01), the evaluation of one's health status as ""average"" (p<0.05), and evaluation of one's physical capacity as ""quite good"" or ""average"" (p<0.01). The occurrence of psycho-emotional stress was mostly influenced by work in the environment requiring increased visual strain (p<0.001) and vibration (p<0.05). We found that the following factors were associated with the occurrence of psycho-emotional stress on the ship: depression that occurred more frequently at sea than on shore (p<0.001), disturbed working and resting regimen due to time zone changes (p<0.001), and disturbed regular sexual life (p<0.001).

MATERIAL/METHODS: Four hundred four office workers with and without involvement in VDT work were included in the study. To evaluate visual strain we used a questionnaire for subjective complaints, evaluated the main ophthalmologic indicators, and measured psycho-physiological indicators. RESULTS: The questionnaire data showed that 88.5% of the VDT workers complained of various vision disorders. VDT workers who complained of worsened vision, redness of the eyes, eye pain, and diplopia during work were found to show more significant changes in the psycho-physiological indicators objectively reflecting strain of the vision analyzer. In the group of people with symptoms of asthenopia, the differences in the indicators of visual sensomotoric reaction, constancy of clear vision, and changes in the periods of clear and unclear vision were statistically reliably greater than in people without symptoms of visual strain. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective perception of visual strain related to VDT work was confirmed by ophthalmologic and psycho-physiological measurements. Changes in ocular and psycho-physiological function before and at the end of the workday are a good objective index of visual and central nervous system strain.","['Ustinaviciene, Ruta', 'Januskevicius, Vidmantas']","['Ustinaviciene R', 'Januskevicius V']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Kaunas University of Medicine, Kaunas Medical University Hospital, Lithuania. ruta.ustinaviciene@med.kmu.lt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,,,,2006/07/05 09:00,2006/10/26 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2005/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['8380 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2006 Jul;12(7):CR296-301.

METHODS: A sequence of cases of three eyes of three adult patients, two females and one male, age ranging from 28 and 49 years (average 38.3 years), who underwent LASIK. Two patients were followed up for eighteen months and one for six months. RESULTS: Comparing the corrected visual acuity before surgery with the non-corrected visual acuity after surgery, one eye gained two lines of vision, one eye remained the same and one eye lost one line of vision. All eyes remained without spheric refraction, and astigmatism did not exceed -0.75 D after surgery. There has been an improvement in the symptoms of asthenopia in the three patients. CONCLUSION: The LASIK technique proved to be efficient in the correction of anisometropy in adults, improving visual accuity and asthenopia complaints, and leading to a similar refraction in both eyes.","['Gus, Patricia Ioschpe', 'Matos, Guilherme Herrmann', 'Bayer, Marcia Cristina']","['Gus PI', 'Matos GH', 'Bayer MC']","['Faculdade Medicina, Universidade Luterana do Brasil, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.']",['por'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Brazil,Arq Bras Oftalmol,Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,0400645,IM,,,,2006/05/16 09:00,2006/10/27 09:00,['2006/05/16 09:00'],"['2006/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0004-27492006000200023 [pii]', '10.1590/s0004-27492006000200023 [doi]']",ppublish,Arq Bras Oftalmol. 2006 Mar-Apr;69(2):261-3. doi: 10.1590/s0004-27492006000200023.

Although subjective reports of improved perception exist, few objective correlates of these effects have been established. METHODS: In a pilot study, 10 children who wore Intuitive Colorimeter lenses, and claimed benefit, and two asymptomatic children were tested. Steady-state potentials were measured in response to low contrast patterns modulating at a frequency of 12 Hz. Four viewing conditions were compared: 1) no lens; 2) Colorimeter lens; 3) lens of complementary color; and 4) spectrally neutral lens with similar photopic transmission. RESULTS: The asymptomatic children showed little or no difference between the lens and no lens conditions. When all the symptomatic children were tested together, a similar result was found. However, when the symptomatic children were divided into two groups depending on their symptoms, an interaction emerged. Children with visual stress but no headaches showed the largest amplitude visual evoked potential response in the no lens condition, whereas those children whose symptoms included severe headaches or migraine showed the largest amplitude visual evoked potential response when wearing their prescribed lens. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that it is possible to measure objective correlates of the beneficial subjective perceptual effects of colored lenses, at least in some children who have a history of migraine or severe headaches.","['Riddell, Patricia M', 'Wilkins, A', 'Hainline, Louise']","['Riddell PM', 'Wilkins A', 'Hainline L']","['Department of Psychology, University of Reading, United Kingdom. p.m.riddell@reading.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2006/05/16 09:00,2006/07/04 09:00,['2006/05/16 09:00'],"['2006/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.opx.0000216125.83236.af [doi]', '00006324-200605000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2006 May;83(5):299-305. doi: 10.1097/01.opx.0000216125.83236.af.,,,20060703,,,"['Adolescent', 'Asthenopia/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Color', 'Contact Lenses/*standards', 'Evoked Potentials, Visual/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis']",,['HD-3077/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Twelve healthy subjects in agegroups of 20, 30, and 40 years were examined before and after several hours of visual display terminal (VDT) work after informed consent. Three trials of forward <-> backward movement of focusing on a target were carried out. Response curves of horizontal eye tracking and pupillary diameter, that is, convergence with miosis and divergence with mydriasis, were recorded continuously, bilaterally and simultaneously by TriIRIS. RESULTS: 1) Normal patterns of vergence and pupillary responses with constant amplitudes were recorded in five subjects and were stable. 2 ) Gradual decline of the mydriatic peak was observed in two subjects, suggesting spastic accommodation. Increasing mydriatic peak or notching of mydriatic phase was seen in one eye each, suggesting tonic disaccommodation. These abnormal patterns were reversed by adequate refractive correction, and classified as an eye-fatigue group. 3) Abruption of miotic phase was observed in two cases of exophoria. 4) Low and declining amplitudes despite normal light response were observed in two subjects, suggesting debilitated accommodation, and they were classified as an eye-strain group. 5) Post-traumatic mydriatic anisocoria responded in parallel, suggesting paretic accommodation. CONCLUSIONS: Coordinated dynamics of near triad responses revealed remarkable characteristics of accommodative iris movements with vergence. These objective findings revealed the different patterns of functional disorder of accommodation.","['Hiraoka, Mari', 'Moroda, Mariko', 'Hashimoto, Yukiko', 'Suganuma, Masako']","['Hiraoka M', 'Moroda M', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Suganuma M']","['Koganei Eye Infirmary, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,,,,2006/04/29 09:00,2006/07/22 09:00,['2006/04/29 09:00'],"['2006/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2006 Apr;110(4):263-70.,,,20060721,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Convergence, Ocular/*physiology', 'Evoked Potentials, Visual', 'Fixation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Humans']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A full-body enclosure containing a calibrated laser pointer was used to assess egocentric localization (i.e., one's perceived sense of ""straight ahead"") in total darkness. Fourteen visually normal subjects were tested in a counterbalanced manner under both experimental (20 pd base-down) and control (plano or zero power) test conditions with each test condition lasting 1 hour. A rating scale questionnaire was also administered to assess quantitatively subjective adaptation to the yoked prisms. RESULTS: Group mean egocentric localization showed approximately 50% adaptation during the 1-hour test period. Subjective adaptation results were similar. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that rapid perceptually driven, sensorimotor adaptation occurred as assessed both objectively and subjectively in response to vertical yoked prisms. These results are similar to those found in other experiments involving short-term adaptation to optical rearrangements.","['Huang, Michael A', 'Ciuffreda, Kenneth J']","['Huang MA', 'Ciuffreda KJ']","['SUNY State College of Optometry, Department of Vision Sciences, New York, New York 10010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2006/04/15 09:00,2006/05/31 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.opx.0000214298.73085.b5 [doi]', '00006324-200604000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2006 Apr;83(4):242-8. doi: 10.1097/01.opx.0000214298.73085.b5.,,,20060530,,,"['Adaptation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/physiopathology/therapy', 'Equipment Design', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors']",,['T35 EY07079/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the vertical and horizontal components of size distortion have not been previously quantified separately. The purpose of this article is to describe horizontal and vertical dysmetropsia occurring in patients following pars plana vitrectomy and gas treatment (octafluoropropane, C(3)F(8) or sulfur hexafluoride, SF(6)) for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four patients (mean+/-SD, 59+/-8 years; three women and one man) who had had pars plana vitrectomy and gas treatment for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment 6-7 months earlier underwent ocular examination, best corrected visual acuity test, threshold horizontal and vertical dysmetropsia measurement using a computerised version of the New Aniseikonia Test, slit-lamp examination and optical coherence tomography of the macula. RESULTS: All patients had binocular visual complaints including difficulty judging distances or reading, rivalry or asthenopia. The logMAR visual acuity (mean+/-SD) in the operated eye was 0.52+/-0.199 and 0.02+/-0.171 in the unaffected eye. All patients perceived the image as smaller (micropsia) with the affected eye, with differences ranging from -9 to 0%. Four patients showed 3% or more size difference between horizontal and vertical meridians. CONCLUSIONS: Dysmetropsia does occur in symptomatic patients following successful surgical repair of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment by pars plana vitrectomy and gas treatment. The effect on image size is heterogenous across the retinal area affected.","['Ugarte, Marta', 'Williamson, Tom H']","['Ugarte M', 'Williamson TH']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, St Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth Palace Road, London, SE1 7EH, UK. mugarte@doctors.org.uk""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,8205248,IM,,,,2006/03/18 09:00,2007/08/21 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00417-006-0290-x [doi]'],ppublish,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2006 Nov;244(11):1545-8. doi: 10.1007/s00417-006-0290-x.

Because little is known about the influence of this cycle on susceptibility to visual discomfort in other situations, we performed a laboratory study using an intensive visual task. METHODS: Twelve female participants, with normal-length menstrual cycles, completed the study. This required them to play a computer game for 30 minutes while viewing the screen through -2.00-D lenses. Questionnaires were used to record symptom changes; visual acuity and near points of accommodation (NPA) and convergence (NPC) were also recorded both before and after the game. The participants performed this task on designated days (5, 12, 19, and 26) of their menstrual cycle chosen because they fall in line with peaks and troughs of ovarian hormone levels. Cycle phase was confirmed by the measurement of salivary estradiol and progesterone levels. RESULTS: The task performed produced clear changes in all metrics examined. Visual discomfort first increased, on average, after 6 minutes; VA declined on average by 0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and NPC and NPA both receded by just over 1 cm. However, none of these changes differed significantly at any stage of the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that visual discomfort, generated by providing increased accommodative demand while viewing a visual display unit, does not vary significantly during the menstrual cycle.","['Howarth, Peter A', 'Clemes, Stacy A']","['Howarth PA', 'Clemes SA']","['Visual Ergonomics Research Group, Department of Human Sciences, Loughborough University, United Kingdom. p.a.howarth@lboro.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2006/03/15 09:00,2006/04/21 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.opx.0000208626.35109.21 [doi]', '00006324-200603000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2006 Mar;83(3):190-4. doi: 10.1097/01.opx.0000208626.35109.21.,,,20060420,"['4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Estradiol/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Menstrual Cycle/*physiology', 'Progesterone/metabolism', 'Saliva/metabolism', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Vision Tests/*instrumentation', 'Visual Acuity/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Prospective study of 31 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral refractive surgery for hyperopia between May 1999 and February 2002. The examination included best-corrected visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, ocular motility, fusion at distance, stereopsis and fusional amplitudes, before and at one month, 3 months, 6 months, one year after surgery and annually thereafter. RESULTS: After refractive surgery, there were changes in visual acuity, residual hyperopic refractive errors, and anisometropic changes that influenced the oculomotor status. The most frequent sensory modifications were suppression at distance, with much less change in stereopsis. From the point of view of ocular motility, we found a significant tendency to esotropia in strabismic patients (p=0.003). In non-strabismic patients, we also found sensorimotor modifications, but of less intensity and with fewer consequences than in strabismic patients.

METHODS: Eight female students were given optical stimuli for accommodation and convergence systems for 1.5 min immediately after 20 min of a sustained task on a 3-D display. Before and after the trial, their ocular functions were measured and their symptoms were assessed. The optical stimuli were applied by moving targets of scenery images far and near around the far point position of both eyes on a horizonal place, which induced divergence in the direction of the eye position of rest. In a control group, subjects rested with closed eyes for 1.5 min instead of applying the optical stimuli. RESULTS: There were significant changes in the accommodative contraction time (from far to near) and the accommodative relaxation time (from near to far) and the lag of accommodation at near target, from 1.26 s to 1.62 s and from 1.49 s to 1.63 s and from 0.5 D to 0.65 D, respectively, and in the symptoms in the control group after the duration of closed-eye rest. In the stimulus group, however, the changes of those functions were smaller than in the control group. CONCLUSION: From these results, we suggest that our designed optical stimuli for accommodation and convergence systems are effective on asthenopia following accommodative dysfunction.","['Iwasaki, Tsuneto', 'Tawara, Akihiko', 'Miyake, Nobuyuki']","['Iwasaki T', 'Tawara A', 'Miyake N']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,,,,2006/02/24 09:00,2006/04/08 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2006 Jan;110(1):5-12.,,,20060407,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Convergence, Ocular/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Photic Stimulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A secondary aim was to discuss the diagnosis of accommodative insufficiency. The chosen cohort was examined on two occasions with 1.8 years in between. The first examination included 72 children, 43 boys (mean age 8.1 years, ranging from 5.8 to 9.8) and 29 girls (mean age 8.3 years, ranging from 6.2 to 10.0). The second examination included 59 of these children, 34 boys (mean age 9.9 years, ranging from 7.8 to 11.7) and 25 girls (mean age 10.1 ranging from 8.0 to 11.8). Subjective symptoms at near work (headache, asthenopia, floating text, facility problems) were recorded and the amplitude and the relative accommodation, both positive and negative, were measured. The result from the questionnaire showed that at the first examination more than one-third of the children (34.7%) reported at least one subjective symptom when doing near work and 42.4% at the second examination. No symptoms were found among children younger than 7.5 years, but for children between 7.5 and 10 years old at the first examination, the prevalence of at least one symptom was 47.2%. At the second examination, symptoms were reported also for the youngest children, i.e. from the age of 8 years. The discrimination ability for the amplitude of accommodation, both monocular and binocular, was significant. In the first examination the difference between the mean for the two groups (i.e. with and without at least one symptom) was around 2.00 D monocular and 3.00 D binocular. Corresponding figures from the second examination was a difference between the mean for the two groups of around 3.50 D monocular and nearly 4.00 D binocular. We suggest that accommodation measurements should be performed more routinely and regularly, maybe as screening, especially in children over 8 years of age.","['Sterner, Bertil', 'Gellerstedt, Martin', 'Sjostrom, Anders']","['Sterner B', 'Gellerstedt M', 'Sjostrom A']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Clinical Neuroscience, SU/Molndal, Molndal, Sweden. sterner@oft.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2006/02/08 09:00,2006/09/16 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['OPO364 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1475-1313.2006.00364.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2006 Mar;26(2):148-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2006.00364.x.,,,20060915,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Age Factors', 'Asthenopia/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Headache/etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Reading', 'Reference Values', 'Students', 'Vision, Binocular', 'Vision, Monocular', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Lacrimal plug was applied in 43 patients (72 eyes) in our clinic from July to October in 2004. Questionnaire was used in these patients before the surgery 3 days and repeated after surgery 1 week and 3 months. Slit lamp microscope examination, fluorescent staining for tear break-up time (BUT), Schirmer test I (STI), impression cytology (IC) were carried out at the same time. RESULTS: Questionnaire indicated most patients complained about dry eye, foreinbody sensation, asthenopia and red eye. These symptoms were relieved obviously after the application of lacrimal plug. Compared with pre-operation, tear production was increased significantly on the surface of eyes and the defect of corneal epithelium was healed in 37 patients (62 eyes). Compared with pre-operation, BUT and STI were increased and elongated on these patients, IC suggests squamous metaplasia of epithelial layer of conjunctiva in these patients was improved. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of patients suffered from dry eye were relieved obviously by using Smart PLUG. Therefore lacrimal plug can be used for patients with serious dry eye by improving tear volume and tear film stability.","['Li, Xue-min', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Wang, Wei']","['Li XM', 'Zhang J', 'Wang W']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Beijing University Third Hospital, Beijing University Ophthalmology Center, Beijing 100083, China. lxmlxm66@sina.com.cn']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,16210540R,IM,,,,2006/01/18 09:00,2009/12/24 06:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Dec;41(12):1098-102.,,,20091223,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca/*therapy', 'Lacrimal Apparatus/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tears/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The symptoms of convergence insufficiency (CI) can make it difficult for a student to concentrate on extended reading and overlap with those of ADHD. METHODS: A retrospective review of 266 patients with CI presenting to an academic pediatric ophthalmology practice was performed. All patients included were diagnosed with CI by one author (DBG) and evaluated for the diagnosis of ADHD. A computerized review was also performed looking at the converse incidence of CI in patients carrying the diagnosis of ADHD. RESULTS: We reviewed 266 charts of patients with CI. Twenty-six patients (9.8%) were diagnosed with ADHD at some time in their clinical course. Of the patients with ADHD and CI, 20 (76.9%) were on medication for ADHD at the time of diagnosis for CI while 6 (23.1%) were either not on medication or the medication was discontinued several months before the diagnosis of CI. The review of computer records showed a 15.9% incidence of CI in the ADHD population. CONCLUSION: We report an apparent three-fold greater incidence of ADHD among patients with CI when compared with the incidence of ADHD in the general US population (1.8-3.3%). We also note a seeming three-fold greater incidence of CI in the ADHD population. This may simply represent an association and not be a causative relationship. Until further studies are performed, however, patients diagnosed with ADHD should be evaluated to identify the small subset that may have CI -- a condition that responds well to treatment at home.","['Granet, David B', 'Gomi, Cintia F', 'Ventura, Ricardo', 'Miller-Scholte, Andrea']","['Granet DB', 'Gomi CF', 'Ventura R', 'Miller-Scholte A']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, Ratner Children's Eye Center, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093, USA. dgranet@ucsd.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Strabismus,Strabismus,9310896,IM,,,,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['UK6851457531GQ0J [pii]', '10.1080/09273970500455436 [doi]']",ppublish,Strabismus. 2005 Dec;13(4):163-8. doi: 10.1080/09273970500455436.,,,20060314,"['0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)', '0 (Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/*complications/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Vision, Binocular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A 30-year-old man presented for treatment of high myopic astigmatism in his right eye resulting from perforating ocular trauma, which occurred 8 years prior to presentation. The corneoscleral wound repair was performed with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) in the right eye was counting fingers at 1 m, best corrected to 20/30 with -7.00 + 5.00 x 110. Visual acuity in the left eye was 20/20 with -1.5 D. The patient was unable to tolerate spectacles and contact lenses because of asthenopia and high astigmatism, respectively. As an alternative, LASIK with the Allegretto Wave excimer laser was performed. RESULTS: Three months postoperatively, UCVA was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/15 in the left eye.

This is part of a larger hypothesis that, because eyelid squint improves vision under conditions of optical defocus and/or glare, and reduced blink rate is assumed to contribute to dry eye symptoms, eyelid squint is part of the mechanism resulting in asthenopia. This study investigates the effect of voluntary eyelid squint on blink activity and on electromyography (EMG) measures from the orbicularis oculi. METHODS: Ten subjects (18 to 38 years of age) performed 3 1-minute trials each (Latin Square order) of voluntary target squint levels of 5%, 20%, 35%, and 50% with respect to previously demonstrated 0% (relaxed) and 100% (maximum) squint levels. EMG recordings using surface electrodes were obtained from the orbicularis muscle. Vertical dimension of the palpebral fissure and eye lid blinks were measured with an ISCAN eye tracker and video recorder. RESULTS: Each target squint level produced significant changes (p<0.0001) in ocular aperture size, EMG power, and EMG amplitude. For target voluntary squint levels of 5%, 20%, 35%, and 50%, the mean squint responses were 24%, 35%, 42%, and 53%, respectively. Blink rate was inversely related to both target squint level and squint response (p<0.0001), decreasing from 15 blinks per minute at 0% squint to 7.5 blinks per minute at 5% target voluntary squint and to 4 blinks per minute at 50% target voluntary squint. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary eyelid squint significantly reduces blink rate by an average of 50% or more dependent on attempted level. Further study is required to determine if involuntary squint causes the same. All tested levels of voluntary squint resulted in an EMG signal from the orbicularis muscle that is measurably different from resting state. This indicates that EMG can be used as a reliable indicator of eyelid squint.","['Sheedy, James E', 'Gowrisankaran, Sowjanya', 'Hayes, John R']","['Sheedy JE', 'Gowrisankaran S', 'Hayes JR']","['The Ohio State University College of Optometry, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. jsheedy@optometry.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2005/11/09 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['00006324-200510000-00012 [pii]', '10.1097/01.opx.0000181234.63194.a7 [doi]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2005 Oct;82(10):905-11. doi: 10.1097/01.opx.0000181234.63194.a7.,,,20060103,,,"['Adult', '*Blinking', 'Electromyography', 'Eyelids/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*physiology', 'Reference Values', 'Strabismus/physiopathology', 'Videotape Recording']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed that asthenopia is a consequence of anomalous oculomotor responses generated by conflict between accommodative and convergence stimuli. The hypothesis was examined by measuring accommodation and convergence continuously with a Shin-Nippon SRW5000 infrared autorefractor and a limbus tracking device. Subjects viewed a high contrast Maltese Cross target at three levels of Gaussian filter target blur under conditions of relatively low- and high-conflict between accommodation and convergence stimuli, the latter inducing the sensation of stereopsis. Under the low-conflict conditions accommodation was stable, but convergence-driven accommodation was dominant when the target was extremely blurred. Under the high-conflict conditions the role of convergence-driven accommodation increased systematically with the degree of target blur. It is proposed that defocus-driven accommodation becomes weak when the target comprises low spatial frequency components. Large accommodative overshoots to step stimuli that are not blurred or only mildly blurred were consistently observed and are attributed to the initial accommodative response being convergence-driven.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and involved sixty subjects with asthenopia and refractive errors between -1.00 and -8.00 diopters in both eyes. Thirty subjects were administered a purified high-dose anthocyanoside oligomer (100 mg tablet comprising 85 % anthocyanoside oligomer), and thirty were given a placebo in tablet form twice daily for 4 weeks. Prior to the treatment, the placebo and anthocyanoside groups were similar in terms of age and contrast sensitivity. Before and after treatment, subjects completed a questionnaire to determine their clinical symptoms and were also assessed for nocturnal visual function using contrast sensitivity testing. Questionnaire data analysis showed that, following treatment, twenty-two (73.3 %) anthocyanoside subjects showed improved symptoms, whereas only one placebo subject showed an improvement (Fisher's exact test, P<0.0001). Contrast sensitivity levels according to each cycle per degree significantly improved in the anthocyanoside group and remained stable in the placebo group. The mean contrast sensitivity change in the anthocyanoside group was 2.41 (SD) 1.91, compared with -0.66 (SD) 2.66 dB for the placebo group (unpaired Student's t test, P<0.0001). At all cycle per degree levels, contrast sensitivity changes in the anthocyanoside group were better than in the placebo group (unpaired Student's t test, P<0.05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study involving 32 patients operated on at the Rouen Teaching Hospital for superior oblique palsy. Group 1 patients were treated by surgical reinforcement of the superior oblique muscle and group 2 patients were treated by surgical loosening (or weakening) of the antagonist muscles. One-year follow-up explored head tilt, diplopia, vertical deviation and cyclotorsion. RESULTS: Functional results (presence of diplopia or stiff neck) were positive in both groups but better in group 1. Only 12.5% of patients required a second operation. Cyclotorsion amounted to less than 2% in group 1 and was still greater than 8% in group 2; on the other hand, vertical deviation had improved more in group 2, where it decreased to 2.1 diopters versus 3.1 in group 1. DISCUSSION: and conclusion: Only reinforcing the superior oblique adequately corrects cyclotorsion, which is the main cause of asthenopia and diplopia, despite an often insufficient height correction that is otherwise clinically well tolerated. We suggest reinforcing the superior oblique as a first intent rather than weakening hyperactive muscles, and in case of excessive postoperative height, we would carry out additional treatment of one of the hyperactive muscles later.","['Genevois, O', 'Beaumont, R', 'Retout, A', 'Quintyn, J-C']","['Genevois O', 'Beaumont R', 'Retout A', 'Quintyn JC']","[""Service d'Ophtalmologie, CHU Charles Nicolle, Rouen, France.""]",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,J Fr Ophtalmol,Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,7804128,IM,,,,2005/06/24 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0181-5512(05)81065-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0181-5512(05)81065-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Fr Ophtalmol. 2005 Apr;28(4):355-62. doi: 10.1016/s0181-5512(05)81065-4.,,,20060221,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trochlear Nerve Diseases/*surgery']",,,,Comparaison de deux techniques chirurgicales dans le traitement de la paralysie du muscle oblique superieur.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial in which 7 healthy volunteers underwent blink rate measurements with a blink rate recording system while viewing a DVD on a computer display for 10 minutes. The measurements were carried out without an AR film on terminal displays initially. The same tasks were performed on the next day with an AR film on the displays. The subjects were also required to score their symptoms of asthenopia on a visual analog scale before and just after DVD viewing. The changes in blink rate and asthenopia scores with AR film use were assessed by the Student t test. RESULTS: The mean baseline blink rate was 15.7 +/- 5.9 blinks /min, which decreased significantly to 9.6 +/- 4.3 blinks/min after DVD viewing without an AR film (P < 0.05). The mean baseline and final blink rates for DVD viewing with an AR film were 14.6 +/- 9.2 and 14.3 +/- 9.2 blinks/min, respectively. There were no significant differences between baseline and final blink rates after DVD viewing with an AR film (P > 0.05). The mean cumulative visual analog asthenopic symptom score after DVD viewing without an AR film was 72 +/- 18% compared with the mean cumulative symptom score of 52 +/- 11% after DVD viewing with an AR film. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Visual display terminal work appears to be associated with asthenopic symptoms and decreased blink rates. The use of AR films on computer displays may prevent both reflections of light from screen surfaces and reduction in blink rates resulting in fewer asthenopic symptoms.","['Miyake-Kashima, Minori', 'Dogru, Murat', 'Nojima, Takayuki', 'Murase, Masayuki', 'Matsumoto, Yukihiro', 'Tsubota, Kazuo']","['Miyake-Kashima M', 'Dogru M', 'Nojima T', 'Murase M', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Tsubota K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Tokyo Dental College, Chiba, Japan. minori.miyake@nifty.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cornea,Cornea,8216186,IM,,,,2005/06/22 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2005/06/22 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['00003226-200507000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/01.ico.0000151564.24989.38 [doi]']",ppublish,Cornea. 2005 Jul;24(5):567-70. doi: 10.1097/01.ico.0000151564.24989.38.,,,20050804,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Blinking/*physiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Female', '*Glare', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, redness, blurred vision, and double vision, collectively referred to as computer vision syndrome. This article describes both the characteristics and treatment modalities that are available at this time. Computer vision syndrome symptoms may be the cause of ocular (ocular-surface abnormalities or accommodative spasms) and/or extraocular (ergonomic) etiologies. However, the major contributor to computer vision syndrome symptoms by far appears to be dry eye. The visual effects of various display characteristics such as lighting, glare, display quality, refresh rates, and radiation are also discussed. Treatment requires a multidirectional approach combining ocular therapy with adjustment of the workstation. Proper lighting, anti-glare filters, ergonomic positioning of computer monitor and regular work breaks may help improve visual comfort. Lubricating eye drops and special computer glasses help relieve ocular surface-related symptoms. More work needs to be done to specifically define the processes that cause computer vision syndrome and to develop and improve effective treatments that successfully address these causes.","['Blehm, Clayton', 'Vishnu, Seema', 'Khattak, Ashbala', 'Mitra, Shrabanee', 'Yee, Richard W']","['Blehm C', 'Vishnu S', 'Khattak A', 'Mitra S', 'Yee RW']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Texas at Houston, Hermann Eye Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Surv Ophthalmol,Survey of ophthalmology,0404551,IM,,,,2005/04/27 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0039-6257(05)00009-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.survophthal.2005.02.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Surv Ophthalmol. 2005 May-Jun;50(3):253-62. doi: 10.1016/j.survophthal.2005.02.008.,,,20050929,,,"['Asthenopia/*etiology/therapy', '*Computer Terminals', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/*etiology/therapy', 'Ergonomics', 'Glare', 'Humans', 'Vision Disorders/*etiology/therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,103,

METHODS: A search was performed of the following databases: Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and MEDLINE. Relevant articles were reviewed and analyzed for strengths and weaknesses. Pertinent sections of classic texts were studied to provide a historical basis and to serve as a source for additional early references. RESULTS: Forty-three refereed studies were obtained. Of these, 14 were clinical trials (10 controlled studies), 18 review articles, 2 historical articles, 1 case report, 6 editorials or letters, and 2 position statements from professional colleges. Many of the references listed by the larger reviews were unpublished or published in obscure or nonrefereed sources and therefore were not accessible. CONCLUSIONS: Eye exercises have been purported to improve a wide range of conditions including vergence problems, ocular motility disorders, accommodative dysfunction, amblyopia, learning disabilities, dyslexia, asthenopia, myopia, motion sickness, sports performance, stereopsis, visual field defects, visual acuity, and general well-being. Small controlled trials and a large number of cases support the treatment of convergence insufficiency. Less robust, but believable, evidence indicates visual training may be useful in developing fine stereoscopic skills and improving visual field remnants after brain damage. As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises in the remainder of the areas reviewed, and their use therefore remains controversial.","['Rawstron, John Albert', 'Burley, Celeste D', 'Elder, Mark J']","['Rawstron JA', 'Burley CD', 'Elder MJ']","['Ophthalmology Department, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus,Journal of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus,7901143,IM,,,,2005/04/14 09:00,2005/04/27 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2005 Mar-Apr;42(2):82-8.,,,20050426,,['J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2005 Mar-Apr;42(2):74.

However, there are numerous reports that adverse effects such as ocular discomfort and headache are associated with these devices. To investigate these adverse effects, questionnaires that have been specifically designed for other purposes such as investigating motion sickness have often been used. The primary purpose of this study was to develop a standard questionnaire for use in investigating symptoms that result from virtual reality viewing. In addition, symptom duration and whether priming subjects elevates symptom ratings were also investigated. METHODS: A list of the most frequently reported symptoms following virtual reality viewing was determined from previously published studies and used as the basis for a pilot questionnaire. The pilot questionnaire, which consisted of 12 nonocular and 11 ocular symptoms, was administered to two groups of eight subjects. One group was primed by having them complete the questionnaire before immersion; the other group completed the questionnaire postviewing only. Postviewing testing was carried out immediately after viewing and then at 2-min intervals for a further 10 min. RESULTS: Priming subjects did not elevate symptom ratings; therefore, the data were pooled and 16 symptoms were found to increase significantly. The majority of symptoms dissipated rapidly, within 6 min after viewing. Frequency of endorsement data showed that approximately half of the symptoms on the pilot questionnaire could be discarded because <20% of subjects experienced them. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom questionnaires to investigate virtual reality viewing can be administered before viewing, without biasing the findings, allowing calculation of the amount of change from pre- to postviewing. However, symptoms dissipate rapidly and assessment of symptoms needs to occur in the first 5 min postviewing. Thirteen symptom questions, eight nonocular and five ocular, were determined to be useful for a questionnaire specifically related to virtual reality viewing using a head-mounted display.","['Ames, Shelly L', 'Wolffsohn, James S', 'McBrien, Neville A']","['Ames SL', 'Wolffsohn JS', 'McBrien NA']","['Department of Optometry and Vision Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2005/03/16 09:00,2005/05/11 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['00006324-200503000-00008 [pii]', '10.1097/01.opx.0000156307.95086.6 [doi]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2005 Mar;82(3):168-76. doi: 10.1097/01.opx.0000156307.95086.6.,,,20050510,,['Optom Vis Sci. 2005 Jul;82(7):571; author reply 571-2.

AIM: To estimate prevalence of musculoskeletal pain/discomfort and visual strain symptoms among data processing workers and to explore associations with work factors. METHODS: A self-report questionnaire was distributed to data processors (n = 175) and a control group (n = 129) in the same organization. RESULTS: Eighty-six per cent of data processors reported musculoskeletal pain/discomfort in the previous year, with the highest prevalence rate found for the neck (58%). The 12 month reported prevalence for visual strain symptoms was 47%, tired eyes (41%) was the most commonly reported symptom. In the last week, 56% reported pain/discomfort and 25% visual strain symptoms. Data processors reporting pain in the previous year were more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs (P < 0.01), to report a lack of choice in deciding what they did at work (P < 0.02), to have insufficient time to complete work (P < 0.05) or to receive help from others when time was limited (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain/discomfort and visual strain symptoms was high among data processors. A systematic approach to risk reduction addressing organizational, psychosocial and physical work factors is required. This study has implications for reorganization of this and other intensive computer work, given the increasing requirement for intensive computing work in many industrial sectors.

METHODS: Twenty-two female students accommodated to a far point shift stimuli during a 2-min period immediately after a 15-min sustained task on a three-dimensional display. Before and after the trial, their accommodative step response and symptoms were assessed. The far point shift stimuli in the optical system, which were presented on a refractometer, were created by moving the target scenery images from far to near, lineally centred about the far point position of each eye. During 2 min of fixating on the far point shift stimuli, changes in refraction were recorded in the same eye. RESULTS: While looking at the far point shift stimuli, 10 of 22 subjects had changes in refraction that showed a hypermetropic shift, and the other 12 subjects had changes in refraction that showed a myopic shift. The time taken for the accommodative step response from far to near post-trial in the myopic shift group was markedly prolonged, and the accommodative lag at the far target in the optometer was significantly increased. In the myopic shift group, the symptoms of ""eye fatigue"", ""eye pain"", ""eye heaviness"", and ""eye dryness"" also increased after the trial. In the hyperopic shift group, however, only the symptom of ""eye dryness"" increased, with no reduction of accommodation function.

Instead, they dynamically scan the visual scene by shifting their eye fixation and focus between objects at different viewing distances. In doing so, the oculomotor processes of accommodation (eye focus) and vergence (angle between lines of sight of two eyes) must be shifted synchronously to place new objects in sharp focus in the center of each retina. Accordingly, nature has reflexively linked accommodation and vergence, such that a change in one process automatically drives a matching change in the other. Conventional stereoscopic displays force viewers to try to decouple these processes, because while they must dynamically vary vergence angle to view objects at different stereoscopic distances, they must keep accommodation at a fixed distance--or else the entire display will slip out of focus. This decoupling generates eye fatigue and compromises image quality when viewing such displays. In an effort to solve this accommodation/vergence mismatch problem, we have built various prototype displays that can vary the focus of objects at different distances in a displayed scene to match vergence and stereoscopic retinal disparity demands and better simulate natural viewing conditions. By adjusting the focus of individual objects in a scene to match their stereoscopic retinal disparity, the cues to ocular accommodation and vergence are brought into agreement. As in natural vision, the viewer brings different objects into focus by shifting accommodation. As the mismatch between accommodation and vergence is decreased, natural viewing conditions are better simulated and eye fatigue should decrease.","['Schowengerdt, Brian T', 'Seibel, Eric J']","['Schowengerdt BT', 'Seibel EJ']","['Human Interface Technology Lab, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-2142, USA. brian@hitl.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cyberpsychol Behav,"Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society",9804397,IM,,,,2005/02/03 09:00,2005/05/13 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cpb.2004.7.610 [doi]'],ppublish,Cyberpsychol Behav. 2004 Dec;7(6):610-20. doi: 10.1089/cpb.2004.7.610.,,,20050512,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Asthenopia/prevention & control', '*Computer Terminals', 'Depth Perception', '*Distance Perception', '*Fixation, Ocular', 'Humans', '*Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Optics and Photonics', '*Visual Perception']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the efficacy and adverse event rates of a new eye lubricant, OptiZen (InnoZen, Inc., polysorbate 80 0.5%) and Visine Original (Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05%). METHODS: In this double-blind parallel arm trial, 50 healthy men and women, ages 18 to 65 years, with symptoms of CVS who use a video display terminal for a minimum of 4 hours per day were randomized to OptiZen (n = 25) or Visine Original (n= 25), 1 to 2 drops b.i.d. for 5 days. The primary end-points were ocular discomfort and adverse events. RESULTS: OptiZen and Visine Original had similar efficacy in alleviating symptoms of ocular discomfort (odds ratio of 1.23 [95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 2.42], P= 0.55). OptiZen and Visine Original were very similar with respect to odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each of the measurement times (P= 0.72). Visine Original users reported a significantly higher incidence of temporary ocular stinging/burning immediately after drug instillation (28%, 7/25) than did OptiZen users (4%, 1/24) (P= 0.05). Patients using OptiZen were 89% less likely to have stinging/burning effects than those patients using Visine Original (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.95). DISCUSSION: OptiZen and Visine Original are effective at alleviating ocular discomfort associated with prolonged computer use. Adverse event findings suggest that OptiZen causes less ocular discomfort on instillation, potentially attributable to its milder ingredient profile.","['Skilling, Francis C Jr', 'Weaver, Tony A', 'Kato, Kenneth P', 'Ford, Jerry G', 'Dussia, Elyse M']","['Skilling FC Jr', 'Weaver TA', 'Kato KP', 'Ford JG', 'Dussia EM']","['Eye Associates of Tallahassee, PA, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optometry,"Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)",100912421,IM,,,,2005/02/03 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s1529-1839(05)70254-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Optometry. 2005 Jan;76(1):47-54. doi: 10.1016/s1529-1839(05)70254-2.,,,20050303,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Polysorbates)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', 'S9U025Y077 (tetrahydrozoline)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/*drug therapy/etiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polysorbates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Surface-Active Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vision Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Internet-based survey was sent to 2,700 radiologists randomly selected from the membership database of the Radiological Society of North America. Questions included demographic information, viewing method, work habits, and workstation design. Common eye strain symptoms were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale. Chi-square analysis, analysis of variance, and step-wise and regression analyses were performed to evaluate codependence of the explanatory variables with eye strain. RESULTS: The adjusted response rate was 14% (380 respondents). The largest age cohort was 36-50 years. The prevalence of eye strain was 36% and was not affected by the viewing method (PACS vs film). Increased symptoms could be independently predicted in radiologists who were women (p <0.001), had longer work days (p=0.009), took fewer breaks (p=0.03), reported screen flicker (p=0.0003), and performed CT screening (p=0.04). Working hours had the strongest influence on eye strain. Eye strain was increased in those who reported studies for longer than 6 hr per day (p=0.01) and decreased in those who took breaks every hour (p=0.04). Symptoms were independent of the length of the break taken and of other workstation and technique factors. CONCLUSION: Eye strain was common among the radiologists in our study population, with no significant difference between PACS and hard-copy film users. Taking frequent short breaks, eliminating screen flicker, and limiting the number of CT screening studies interpreted may improve symptoms.","['Vertinsky, Talia', 'Forster, Bruce']","['Vertinsky T', 'Forster B']","['Department of Radiology, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, 899 W 12th Ave., Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

Also, preventive measures for fatigue have been proposed and the office-working environment has been improved. To examine the effects of the rapid changes in working conditions and environment on the health of VDT workers, we conducted a questionnaire survey in 2002. A self-reported questionnaire was distributed to 3,927 office workers; 2,374 (60.5%) responded. Subjects whose questionnaires had missing data were excluded from analysis. As a result, 1,406 (male: 1,069, female: 337) workers aged 20 to 59 were subjected to analysis. By a logistic regression model, we examined the association between VDT use and visual and musculoskeletal symptoms. Prevalence of eye strain and/or pain (72.1%) was the highest, followed by neck stiffness and/or pain (59.3%), low back stiffness and/or pain (30.0%) and hand or arm strain and/or pain (13.9%). Women consistently reported more discomfort than men. As a result of the logistic regression model, eye strain and/or pain was associated with dissatisfaction with airflow, but not with factors affecting visual symptoms as reported in previous studies, for example, reflection of light and blurred characters on the screen. It was thought that airflow appeared as a risk factor because the lighting environment had been improved in offices to prevent reflection of light on the screen. Neck stiffness and/or pain was associated with raising the shoulders during VDT work, the unsuitable shape of the computer mouse for a hand, and the inconvenient arrangement of the mouse in relation to the body. Hand or arm strain and/or pain were associated with the arrangement of the mouse and inappropriate height of the desk. Low back stiffness and/or pain were associated with dissatisfaction with the chair and using the keyboard without a wrist rest. Although measures to prevent fatigue had been implemented for VDT workers, risk factors for musculoskeletal symptoms would be the same as in previous studies.","['Iwakiri, Kazuyuki', 'Mori, Ippei', 'Sotoyama, Midori', 'Horiguchi, Kaori', 'Ochiai, Takanori', 'Jonai, Hiroshi', 'Saito, Susumu']","['Iwakiri K', 'Mori I', 'Sotoyama M', 'Horiguchi K', 'Ochiai T', 'Jonai H', 'Saito S']","['National Institute of Industrial Health, 21-1, Nagao 6-chome, Tama-ku, Kawasaki 214-8585, Japan. iwakiri@niih.go.jp']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Sangyo Eiseigaku Zasshi,Sangyo eiseigaku zasshi = Journal of occupational health,9507473,IM,,,,2005/01/20 09:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2005/01/20 09:00'],"['2005/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1539/sangyoeisei.46.201 [doi]'],ppublish,Sangyo Eiseigaku Zasshi. 2004 Nov;46(6):201-12. doi: 10.1539/sangyoeisei.46.201.,,,20050201,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Work/psychology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An observational study in order to identify the risk factors leading to the CVS was done. Twenty-eight participants answered a validated questionnaire, and had their workstations examined. The questionnaire evaluated personal, environmental, ergonomic factors, and physiologic response of computer users. The distance from the eye to the computers' monitor (A), the computers' monitor height (B), and visual axis height (C) were measured. The difference between B and C was calculated and labeled as D. Angles of gaze to the computer monitor were calculated using the formula: angle=tan(-1)(D/ A). Angles were divided into two groups: participants with angles of gaze ranging from 0 degrees to 13.9 degrees were included in Group 1; and participants gazing at angles larger than 14 degrees were included in Group 2. Statistical analysis of the evaluated variables was made. RESULTS: Computer users in both groups used more tear supplements (as part of the syndrome) than expected. This association was statistically significant (p<0.10). Participants in Group 1 reported more pain than participants in Group 2. Associations between the CVS and other personal or ergonomic variables were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that most important factor leading to the syndrome is the angle of gaze at the computer monitor. Pain in computer users is diminished when gazing downwards at angles of 14 degrees or more. The CVS remains an under estimated and poorly understood issue at the workplace. The general public, health professionals, the government, and private industries need to be educated about the CVS.","['Izquierdo, Juan C', 'Garcia, Maribel', 'Buxo, Carmen', 'Izquierdo, Natalio J']","['Izquierdo JC', 'Garcia M', 'Buxo C', 'Izquierdo NJ']","['Academia Perpetuo Socorro, Miramar, Puerto Rico.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Puerto Rico,Bol Asoc Med P R,Boletin de la Asociacion Medica de Puerto Rico,7505267,IM,,,,2004/12/08 09:00,2005/02/09 09:00,['2004/12/08 09:00'],"['2004/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bol Asoc Med P R. 2004 Mar-Apr;96(2):103-10.,,,20050208,['0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)'],,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Back Pain/etiology/prevention & control', '*Computer Terminals', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Ergonomics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interior Design and Furnishings', 'Male', 'Medical Secretaries', 'Middle Aged', 'Neck Pain/etiology/prevention & control', 'Occupational Diseases/drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Ophthalmic Solutions/therapeutic use', ""Physicians' Offices"", 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Syndrome', 'Workplace']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UMA was defined as that specific refractive state where an unequivocally myopic eye is paired with a 'plano' [spherical equivalent refraction, (SER) = +/-0.25 Dioptres (D)] companion eye. METHODS: The clinical records of all patients aged <19 years on file at an established independent optometric practice were categorised as 'myopic' (SER < or =-0.50 D), 'hypermetropic' (> or =+0.75 D) or 'emmetropic' (> or =-0.37< or =+0.62 D). Subsequently all juvenile patients matching the UMA criterion, together with a case-matched group of bilaterally myopic individuals, were selected as the comparative study populations. RESULTS: A total of 14.4% (n = 21 of 146) of the juvenile myopic case histories were identified as cases of UMA. More than half of these UMA cases emerged between the ages of 11.5 and 13.5 years. There was a marked female gender bias. The linear gradient of the age-related mean refractive trend in the myopic eye of the UMA population was not statistically significantly different (p > 0.1) to that fitted to the ametropic progression recorded in either eye of the case-matched population of young bilateral myopes; uniquely the slope associated with the companion eye of UMA cases was statistically significantly (p < 0.025) less steep. Compared with bilateral myopes fewer cases of UMA required a refractive correction to relieve visual or asthenopic symptoms, and this initial correction was dispensed on average 1 year later (at age 12.7 years) in UMA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals identified as demonstrating clinically-defined UMA can be considered as distinct but functionally normal cases on the continuum of human refractive error. However, any unilaterally-acting determining factor(s) underlying the genesis of the condition remain obscure.","['Pointer, Jonathan S', 'Gilmartin, Bernard']","['Pointer JS', 'Gilmartin B']","['Optometric Research, 4A Market Square, Higham Ferrers, Northants NN10 8BP, UK. jonathan.pointer@virgin.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2004/08/19 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/19 05:00'],"['2004/08/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1475-1313.2004.00226.x [doi]', 'OPO226 [pii]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2004 Sep;24(5):458-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2004.00226.x.,,,20041124,,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anisometropia/*physiopathology', 'Asthenopia/rehabilitation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Myopia/*physiopathology', 'Refraction, Ocular/physiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Vision Disorders/rehabilitation', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2004 Nov;24(6):607']

Migraine may additionally be associated with aura; those focal neurological symptoms that may precede or sometimes accompany the headache. This review describes the optometric aspects of migraine headache. There have been claims of a relationship between migraine headaches and errors of refraction, binocular vision anomalies, pupil anomalies, visual field changes and pattern glare. The quality of the evidence for a relationship between errors of refraction and binocular vision and migraine is poor. The quality of the evidence to suggest a relationship between migraine headache and pupil anomalies, visual field defects and pattern glare is stronger. In particular the link between migraine headache and pattern glare is striking. The therapeutic use of precision-tinted spectacles to reduce pattern glare (visual stress) and to help some migraine sufferers is described.","['Harle, Deacon E', 'Evans, Bruce J W']","['Harle DE', 'Evans BJ']","['The Institute of Optometry, 56-62 Newington Causeway, London, UK. dharle@ioo.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2004/08/19 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/19 05:00'],"['2004/08/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1475-1313.2004.00212.x [doi]', 'OPO212 [pii]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2004 Sep;24(5):369-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2004.00212.x.,,,20041124,,,"['Asthenopia/complications/physiopathology', 'Brain/physiopathology', 'Color', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Migraine Disorders/classification/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Pupil Disorders/complications/physiopathology', 'Refractive Errors/complications/physiopathology', 'Vision Disorders/complications/*physiopathology', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology', 'Visual Fields/physiology', 'Visual Perception/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,148,

METHODS: According to a prospective protocol, we studied five adults presenting with diplopia, and one with convergence-related asthenopia. No patient recalled or had any clinical suspicion of orbital fracture at initial evaluation. Surface coil magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits was performed at 312 microm resolution, slice thickness 2 mm. Quasicoronal images in central gaze were supplemented with eccentric gaze positions, and sagittal and axial images as indicated. RESULTS: Five patients had incomitant hypertropia, and one had abducens paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed previously unsuspected blow out fractures in all six patients. Three patients had medial wall fracture, one bilaterally. Two patients had inferior wall fractures, and one inferomedial. Although only one patient had an extraocular muscle displaced into a sinus, all had evidence of orbital connective tissue distortion in the region of the rectus extraocular muscle pulleys influencing muscle paths. These effects altered the presentations of more familiar pathologies such as superior oblique palsy. After learning of the MRI findings, most patients then recalled orbital trauma from as early as childhood. CONCLUSION: Unsuspected blow out fractures occur and may confound the usual findings in complex strabismus. High-resolution orbital imaging can detect blow out fractures and clarify the pathophysiology, enabling appropriate surgical management.","['Ortube, Maria Carolina', 'Rosenbaum, Arthur L', 'Goldberg, Robert A', 'Demer, Joseph L']","['Ortube MC', 'Rosenbaum AL', 'Goldberg RA', 'Demer JL']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Jules Stein Eye Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J AAPOS,Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,9710011,IM,,,,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jaapos.2004.01.011 [doi]', 'S1091853104000357 [pii]']",ppublish,J AAPOS. 2004 Jun;8(3):264-73. doi: 10.1016/j.jaapos.2004.01.011.,,,20040817,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis', 'Connective Tissue Diseases/diagnosis', 'Diplopia/diagnosis', 'Eye Movements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbit/*pathology', 'Orbital Fractures/*diagnosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Strabismus/*diagnosis', 'Visual Fields']",,"['R01 EY008313-11/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313-14/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313-12/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-8313/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313-13/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313-10/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its clinical features include eye elevation with concomitant vertical deviation in adduction, an abnormal head posture from which the patient is unaware (head turned and tilted towards the healthy side), a moderate subjective excyclotorsion, and a positive Bielschowsky head tilt test. Despite its anglo-saxon denomination as ""congenital fourth nerve palsy"", it is not a paretic disorder. Strabismus surso-adductorius differs from fourth nerve palsy both by etiology and by symptoms. A proper diagnosis is important as neuroradiological examination is mandatory in cases of acquired non-traumatic fourth nerve palsy, whereas decompensated strabismus surso-adductorius can be operated on without any further investigations. Early on, the oculomotor disorder is often well compensated and it does manifest at the adult age. Asthenopia and intermittent vertical diplopia appear as the fusional mechanisms fade out. The best surgical technique for strabismus surso-adductorius is an inferior oblique weakening procedure.

METHODS: The survey employed a descriptive cross-sectional design. Data were generated through the use of a structured self-administered questionnaire and a non-participant observation checklist. RESULTS: Between 39% and 47% of the respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the level of control of the factors of the work environment (heat, noise, illumination, space, ergonomics). Two-thirds of respondents presented with work-related low backache, and this was more so for respondents who had spent at least 10 years on the job than those who had spent less. Of the 227 keyboard operators interviewed, 130 (57%) experienced symptoms suggestive of the overuse syndrome and 70% of the 82 computer operators interviewed had experienced varying degrees of visual fatigue since their appointments. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the present design and layout of offices/workstations and access to equipment at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife is not optimal and tend to promote unnecessary physical efforts. This, in turn, might reduce efficiency and productivity. Suggestions for improvement were made as a way forward.","['Ijadunola, K T', 'Ijadunola, M Y', 'Onayade, A A', 'Abiona, T C']","['Ijadunola KT', 'Ijadunola MY', 'Onayade AA', 'Abiona TC']","['Department of Community Health, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Nigeria,Niger J Med,Nigerian journal of medicine : journal of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria,100888321,IM,,,,2004/01/24 05:00,2004/03/19 05:00,['2004/01/24 05:00'],"['2004/01/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Niger J Med. 2003 Jul-Sep;12(3):134-9.,,,20040318,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders/*etiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Low Back Pain/*etiology/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology/psychology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Perception', '*Universities', 'Workplace/organization & administration/psychology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for a new method for the detailed evaluation of natural and artificial light in 'near work' situations, involving the assessment of luminance, is described. METHODS: The procedure comprises four successive phases: (1) identify object/images observed during work tasks; (2) outline the area of the operator's visual field where gaze is predominantly directed; (3) measure luminances in the visual field, pin-pointing all sources of primary and secondary luminance, and constructing iso-luminance maps; and (4) compare luminance ratios. RESULTS: The procedure was illustrated using the common example of near work in an office environment. Illuminance was found to be inadequate to evaluate the effects of natural and artificial environmental light in the workplace. This is due to the fact that the luxmeter is designed to integrate the light detected over a large angle, whereas in near work the operator's retina is mainly stimulated by light originating from objects/images placed in the occupational visual field. CONCLUSIONS: A detailed measurement of luminance within the occupational visual field is consistent with ocular anatomy and physiology, and can be used as part of a risk assessment for visual disturbances and to rationalize lighting at workstations.","['Piccoli, B', 'Soci, G', 'Zambelli, P L', 'Pisaniello, D']","['Piccoli B', 'Soci G', 'Zambelli PL', 'Pisaniello D']","[""Department of Occupational Health, Universita' Degli Studi, University of Milan, Via S Barnaba 8, Milan 20122, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Occup Hyg,The Annals of occupational hygiene,0203526,IM,,,,2004/01/14 05:00,2004/05/07 05:00,['2004/01/14 05:00'],"['2004/01/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/annhyg/meg076 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Occup Hyg. 2004 Jan;48(1):29-38. doi: 10.1093/annhyg/meg076.,,,20040506,,,"['Asthenopia/*prevention & control', 'Computer Terminals/standards', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Humans', 'Lighting/*standards', 'Occupational Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Occupational Health', 'Photometry', 'Visual Fields/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out by a multidisciplinary team. It included: ergonomic analysis of work, individual and group interviews, and 553 self applied questionnaires in two enterprises. The comparison population numbered 136 workers in different occupations. RESULTS: The study population mainly comprised young males. Among systems analysts, visual fatigue was associated with mental workload, inadequate equipment and workstation, low level of worker participation, being a woman, and subject's attitude of fascination by the computer. Nervousness and intellectual performance were associated with mental workload, inadequate equipment, work environment, and tools. Continuing education and leisure were protective factors. Work interfering in family life was associated with mental workload, difficulties with clients, strict deadlines, subject's attitude of fascination by the computer, and finding solutions of work problems outside work. Family support, satisfaction in life and work, and adequate work environment and tools were protective factors. Work interfering in personal life was associated with subject's attitude of fascination by the computer, strict deadlines, inadequate equipment, and high level of work participation. Satisfaction in life and work and continuing education were protective factors. The comparison population did not share common working factors with the systems analysts in the regression analysis.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the particular sensations or their location vary dependent on the symptom-inducing condition. METHODS: Twenty subjects with good vision performed eight reading tasks in random order during different conditions. Each condition used different stimuli to induce asthenopia. The eight conditions were mixed astigmatism, close viewing distance, upward gaze, dry eyes, lens flipper, small font, glare, and flickering light. Subjects were asked to read until attaining a level of discomfort self-defined as ""barely tolerable."" After each task, subjects rated the magnitude of several symptom descriptors (burning, ache, strain, irritation, tearing, blurred vision, double vision, dryness, and headache) and their location. RESULTS: Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to determine that all of the individual symptom sensation measures (except blur) were significantly related (p values ranged from 0.003 to <0.0001) to the inducing condition. Principal factor analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation was used to test symptom by condition relationships and determined two latent factors, designated external and internal symptom factors (ESF and ISF), that related symptoms to inducing condition. The ESF pattern comprises burning, irritation, tearing, and dryness located in the front and bottom of the eye. ESF is caused by holding the eyelid open, glare, up gaze, small font, and flickering. ESF seems highly related to dry-eye symptoms. The ISF pattern comprises ache, strain, and headache located behind the eyes. ISF is caused by the close viewing distance, lens flipper, and mixed astigmatism conditions and is likely related to accommodative and vergence stress. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom descriptors and locations were able to distinguish discomfort on the basis of causative condition. Results support two different symptom constellations and, hence, at least two different afferent pathways for symptoms of asthenopia.","['Sheedy, James E', 'Hayes, John N', 'Engle, Jon']","['Sheedy JE', 'Hayes JN', 'Engle J']","['The Ohio State University, College of Optometry, Columbus, OH 43218, USA. sheedy2@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006324-200311000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2003 Nov;80(11):732-9. doi: 10.1097/00006324-200311000-00008.,,,20040120,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/etiology/physiopathology', 'Convergence, Ocular/physiology', 'Glare', 'Humans', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vision Disorders/complications/diagnosis/physiopathology']",,['T35-EY07151/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: We carried out a multidisciplinary investigation on a group of 660 VDU operators working for a service agency, aimed at analysing the relationship between ophthalmological, musculoskeletal and neuropsychological parameters and asthenopia. METHODS: In this study we propose a method for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the asthenopic syndrome based on data collected with an easy semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between asthenopia and refractive alteration was noted, whereas a significant association was observed between a lengthened convergence near point and the average time of daily VDU exposure. A significant relationship was also shown between asthenopia, cervical and lumbar disorders, and neuropsychological symptoms. The method for evaluation of asthenopia and the results of this study suggest useful implications in health surveillance programs. After an appropriate validation procedure, this method could represent a useful screening tool and a valid support for preventive interventions. The use of this instrument in longitudinal studies will also provide the opportunity of verifying the existence of long-term effects due to VDU exposure.","['Carta, Angela', 'Pasquini, Luisa', 'Lucchini, R', 'Semeraro, F', 'Apostoli, P']","['Carta A', 'Pasquini L', 'Lucchini R', 'Semeraro F', 'Apostoli P']","['Cattedra di Medicina del Lavoro e Igiene Industriale, Universita degli Studi di Brescia, Servizio di Medicina del Lavoro, Azienda Spedali Civili di Brescia.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,IM,,,,2003/11/19 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 2003 Sep-Oct;94(5):466-79.,,,20031212,,,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/epidemiology/etiology', 'Asthenopia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pain/epidemiology/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Refractive Errors/epidemiology/etiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,"Studio delle relazioni fra astenopia ed alcuni parametri oftalmologici, neuropsicologici e muscolo-scheletrici in lavoratori addetti al VDT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the paper reports on measurements of the accuracy of ocular convergence during fixation of central fusion stimuli (i. e. fixation disparity) as a function of viewing distance. METHODS: Different versions of subjective tests for fixation disparity (using dichoptic nonius lines) are presented, including a computer-controlled procedure (the eye-test PC). RESULTS: These new tests suggest that non-presbyopic subjects with normal binocular vision may suffer from asthenopic complaints if they have - in near vision - an exo fixation disparity larger than average. CONCLUSION: In these cases, the stress exercised on the convergence system can be reduced by using a longer viewing distance at the workplace.","['Jaschinski, Wolfgang']",['Jaschinski W'],"['Institut fur Arbeitsphysiologie an der Universitat Dortmund, Germany.

Many of these patients have normal heterophoria at distance and near, making the etiology of such symptoms perplexing. We performed a visual examination of patients having normal heterophoria at distance and near in order to investigate which visual analysis tests differentiate symptomatic from asymptomatic patients. METHODS: Eighty subjects (30 symptomatic, 50 asymptomatic) with ages between 18 to 35 years of either sex and any race were pooled based on vision-symptom level determined by a 9-question standardized visual-symptoms questionnaire scored using a 100-point scale (asymptomatic: score > or = 85; symptomatic: score < or = 75). Inclusion/exclusion criteria included vision correctable to 6/6 (20/20) Snellen acuity or better in each eye, normal phorias, no latent cyclovertical heterophoria, and normal ocular health. RESULTS: Of the 30 symptomatic patients, 18 had reduced vergence facility response using 3 pd base-in/12 pd base-out loose prism at distance (n = 10; t-score = 2.41, p < 0.02, d = 76) and near (n = 15; t-score = 3.32, p < 0.01, df = 78) with a significant difference beyond the 0.02 level. No other test including measurement of accommodation, showed a significant between-group difference. However, three patients with normal vergence facility (distance and near) showed a reduced binocular accommodative facility response (+/-2.00 D at 40 cm). CONCLUSION: Given a patent with asthenopia, normal phorias, and visual acuity, a differential diagnosis may be made based primarily on using vergence facility and accommodative facility testing.

METHODS: Twenty female students fixed on optical outward-shift stimuli at accommodation for 2 min immediately after 15 min of a sustained task on a 3-D display. Before and after the trial task and the outward shift stimuli, their accommodative step response was measured and their subjective symptoms were assessed. The outward shift stimuli in the optical system, which was set on a refractometer, were presented by moving the target scenery images from far to near and near to far repetitively a round both eyes' far point position. At the same time as the accommodation measurements, the changes of refraction were recorded from the same eye. RESULTS: While looking at the outward shift stimuli, the refraction of 9 out of 20 subjects showed an outward shift and that of the other 11 subjects shifted inward. The post-trial value of contraction (from far to near) time of accommodative step response in the inward-shift group was markedly prolonged, from 0.86 s to 0.97 s (p = 0.043), and the post-trial accommodative power at the far target was shifted outward; from +1.21 D to +1.13 D(p = 0.048). The subjective symptoms of ""ocular fatigue"", ""eye heaviness"" and ""eye dryness"" also increased after the is(p = 0.0035, p = 0.0038, p = 0.0162, respectively). In the outward-shift group, however, no statistical changes were found. CONCLUSION: From these results, we suggested that accommodative relaxation produced by outward shift stimuli at accommodation is effective in reducing of asthenopia following the deterioration of accommodative functions.","['Iwasaki, Tsuneto', 'Tawara, Akihiko', 'Miyake, Nobuyuki']","['Iwasaki T', 'Tawara A', 'Miyake N']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu 807-8555, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,,,,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/06/28 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2003 May;107(5):257-64.,,,20030627,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides anisometropes (with a prevalence of 5-10% in the population above age 20 years), also pseudophakes and refractive surgery patients are at risk. For example, 40% of the pseudophakes seem to suffer from aniseikonia. Reliable measurement and management of aniseikonia is therefore important. The ""Aniseikonia Inspector"" is a new, commercially available, software product to measure and manage aniseikonia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this aniseikonia test of the Aniseikonia Inspector. METHODS: Aniseikonia was induced in four subjects, with normal vision, by means of afocal size lenses. Using the Aniseikonia Inspector, the resulting aniseikonia was measured in vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions. RESULTS: The average ratio between the measured aniseikonia and the induced aniseikonia was 0.98, 0.89 and 0.93 respectively for the vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions. For two consecutive measurements of the same aniseikonic state, the difference in measurement value was 97%, 75% and 94% of the time within one resolution step size (0.5% horizontally and vertically, and 0.7% diagonally). CONCLUSION: Aniseikonia was measured accurately. Measurements in the vertical direction were more accurate than in the diagonal or horizontal directions, which is probably due to fixation disparities. The Aniseikonia Inspector is a very useful new tool in treating the growing number of aniseikonia patients.","['de Wit, Gerard C']",['de Wit GC'],"['Optical Diagnostics, Eikvaren 19, 4102 XE Culemborg, The Netherlands. dewit@opticaldiagnostics.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Binocul Vis Strabismus Q,Binocular vision & strabismus quarterly,9607281,IM,,,,2003/05/27 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/27 05:00'],"['2003/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Binocul Vis Strabismus Q. 2003;18(2):87-94; discussion 94.,,,20030708,,,"['Adult', 'Aniseikonia/*diagnosis', 'CD-ROM', '*Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological', 'Humans', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Software']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that lowering screen height, starting from 15 cm above the baseline (i.e. top of the screen level with eye height while sitting), decreased the ear-eye angle, increased the viewing angle, increased the viewing angle relative to the ear-eye line, and increased the muscle activity of the neck extensor muscles. There were also some significant time effects on postural angles and muscle activity. In this study there were only rare occurrences of muscle fatigue, defined as a simultaneous increase in EMG amplitude and a shift of the EMG power spectrum to lower frequencies.

We conducted a prospective study to determine which factors are predictive of successfully weaning children from spectacles. METHODS: Beginning in 1995, children with fully accommodative esotropia with a baseline refractive error of + 1.50 to + 5.00 diopters (D) were gradually weaned from their hyperopic correction. Patients with amblyopia or who had previously undergone strabismus surgery were excluded. Children were weaned in 0.50 D increments until spectacles were discontinued or they developed esotropia, asthenopia, or decreased vision. A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the association between successful weaning and various clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Twelve of 20 children (60%) were successfully weaned from spectacles. Spectacles were prescribed at a mean age of 4.2 +/- 1.5 years, and weaning was initiated at a mean age of 8.0 +/- 1.1 years. The spherical equivalent of the least hyperopic eye when spectacles were prescribed was 2.99 +/- 1.06 D. The clinical characteristic most clearly associated with successful weaning was the refractive error at the time glasses were prescribed. Whereas 10 of 11 (91%) patients with < 3 D of hyperopia were weaned from spectacles, only 2 of 9 (22%) patients with 3 to 5 D of hyperopia were successfully weaned from their spectacles (P =.005). CONCLUSIONS: Many children with fully accommodative esotropia can be weaned out of spectacles during the grade school years. The degree of baseline hyperopia appears to be one of the best predictors of success.","['Lambert, Scott R', 'Lynn, Michael', 'Sramek, Jodi', 'Hutcheson, Kelly A']","['Lambert SR', 'Lynn M', 'Sramek J', 'Hutcheson KA']","['Emory Eye Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J AAPOS,Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,9710011,IM,,,,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/10/30 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1067/mpa.2003.S1091853102420101 [doi]', 'S1091853102420101 [pii]']",ppublish,J AAPOS. 2003 Feb;7(1):7-13. doi: 10.1067/mpa.2003.S1091853102420101.,,,20031029,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Esotropia/*physiopathology/*therapy', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperopia/therapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies']",,['P30 EY06360/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: The correlations suggest a relationship between cumulative amount of nearwork, decreased accommodative facility and asthenopia.","['Iribarren, R', 'Fornaciari, A', 'Hung, G K']","['Iribarren R', 'Fornaciari A', 'Hung GK']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Centro Medico San Luis, San Martin de Tours 2980, (1425) Capital Federal, Argentina. rafael@ar.inter.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int Ophthalmol,International ophthalmology,7904294,IM,,,,2003/04/08 05:00,2003/04/24 05:00,['2003/04/08 05:00'],"['2003/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1022521228541 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Ophthalmol. 2001;24(4):205-12. doi: 10.1023/a:1022521228541.,,,20030423,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology', 'Computers', 'Humans', 'Reading', 'Regression Analysis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology', 'Visual Acuity', '*Work']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on issues relating to 'work and vision' have predominantly addressed industrial accidents and the toxic effects of exposure to chemical and physical agents, with secondary prevention being more common than primary prevention. In recent years, the huge transformations implemented in workplaces, mainly due to computer-based technologies, demand a progressively higher efficiency of the eye and the related nervous system components that co-ordinate eye movements and accommodation. At the moment these aspects are managed by medical, psychosocial and a variety of technical disciplines, without any shared criteria, terminology and method. Objectives of the Committee are: to investigate holistically the many possible hazards associated to the occupational visual performance; to come to a consensus on terminology, risk assessment and health surveillance procedures. The present status of research and practice in ergophthalmology does not allow for clear-cut decision about health risk and nor is there a clear direction on the prevention of work-related ocular and visual disturbances and disorders. Specifically, at least three determinants must be objectively considered, namely: (a) visual effort; (b) environmental agents; (c) individual characteristics. Although criteria exist for the evaluation of some of these determinants, a greater refinement is necessary 'for a good working life' of the visual apparatus. The ICOH Scientific Committee on 'Work and Vision' is seeking to systematically develop this matter, yielding a more rational and complete approach to the relationship between work and vision.","['Piccoli, Bruno']",['Piccoli B'],"['Department of Occupational Health, University of Milan-ICO Hospital Via San Barnaba, Italy. bpiccoli@mialserver.unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Consensus Development Conference', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,,,,2003/03/15 04:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['R11CEYF2L16TY42J [pii]', '10.1080/0014013031000067473 [doi]']",ppublish,Ergonomics. 2003 Mar 15;46(4):384-406. doi: 10.1080/0014013031000067473.,,,20030507,,,"['*Advisory Committees', 'Asthenopia/etiology/psychology', 'Environmental Monitoring/methods', 'Ergonomics/*methods', 'Eye Infections/etiology', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', '*International Cooperation', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', '*Occupational Health', 'Ophthalmology/methods/*trends', 'Vision Disorders/etiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['ICOH Scientific Committee'],,,,,,,90,['Ergonomics. 2003 Jun 20;46(8):873']

However, the targets used for measuring fixation disparity contain artificial features in that the fusional contours are thinned out. We considered that stereoacuity might be a preferable indicator of vergence accuracy, as stereo targets represent natural viewing conditions. METHODS: We measured fixation disparity with a computer adaptation of Ogle's test and stereoacuity with the automatic Freiburg Stereoacuity Test. Eight subjects were examined under increasing base-in and base-out prisms. RESULTS: The response of fixation disparity to prismatic stress revealed the curve types described by Ogle and Crone. All eight subjects reached a stereoscopic threshold below 10 arcsec. In seven subjects the stereoscopic threshold increased before double vision occurred. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that stereoacuity is suitable to assess the range of binocular vision under prismatic stress. As stereoacuity bears the advantage over fixation disparity in that it can be measured without introducing artificial viewing conditions, we suggest exploring whether stereoacuity under prismatic stress would be more meaningful in the work-up of asthenopic patients than is fixation disparity.","['Kromeier, Miriam', 'Schmitt, Christina', 'Bach, Michael', 'Kommerell, Guntram']","['Kromeier M', 'Schmitt C', 'Bach M', 'Kommerell G']","['Abteilung Neuroophthalmologie und Schielbehandlung, Universitats-Augenklinik Freiburg, Killianstr 5, 79106 Freiburg, Germany. kromeier@aug.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2003/01/22 04:00,2003/03/07 04:00,['2003/01/22 04:00'],"['2003/01/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['089 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1475-1313.2003.00089.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2003 Jan;23(1):43-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1475-1313.2003.00089.x.,,,20030306,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', '*Eye Movements', 'Eyeglasses', 'Humans', 'Vision Disparity', '*Vision, Binocular', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For Patient 1, electrode anatomical registration, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and electrophysiological responses confirmed the location of two contacts in the geniculate body and one in the optic radiation. The first responses peaked approximately 40 milliseconds in the LGN in Patient 1 and 60 milliseconds in the V1/V2 complex in Patients 2 and 3. Moreover, steady state visual-evoked potentials evoked by the unperceived but commonly experienced video-screen flicker were recorded in the LGN, optic radiation, and V1/V2 visual areas. This study provides topographic and temporal propagation characteristics of steady state visual-evoked potentials along human visual pathways. We discuss the possible relationship between the oscillating signal recorded in subcortical and cortical areas and the electroencephalogram abnormalities observed in patients suffering from photosensitive epilepsy, particularly video-game epilepsy.

The study also evaluates the associated symptoms before and after therapy. METHODS: As many optometrists diagnose CI solely on the basis of near point of convergence (NPC) and treat only when symptoms are present (Letourneau et al., 1979; Rouse et al., 1997), in this study CI was defined as NPC of 10 cm or greater (either with or without the presence of asthenopic symptoms for near work) accompanied by exophoria greater at near than at distance. The effect of treatment by optometric vision therapy (OVT) on the NPC and number of symptoms was investigated for 92 patients by retrospectively reviewing the clinical records. Success was defined as the restoration of NPC to normal values and significant reduction in the presenting symptoms. RESULTS: The effect of treatment on the NPC was shown to be highly significant (t = 14.61, p < 0.001). Although treatment times were slightly longer, the success rates were higher than reported by other authors. Post-treatment values for NPC were: <10 cm (98.9%), <8.5 cm (95.7%) and <6.5 cm (80.4%). Longer treatment times were noted for patients who complained that the text appeared to move (chi2, p = 0.007).

The benefit from coloured filters can be demonstrated with the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (WRRT). Previous research using individually prescribed coloured overlays (sheets of plastic placed on a page) found that between one-fifth and one-third of unselected school-children show a significant (> 5%) improvement in their rate of reading with their chosen overlay. This 5% cut-off has good sensitivity and specificity for predicting those children who will continue to voluntarily use their overlay for a sustained period. Previous research has concentrated on children, and we sought to investigate the immediate effect of overlays on rate of reading in an adult population. Subjects were 113 unselected university students who answered a symptom questionnaire and were tested with the Wilkins Intuitive Overlays and WRRT. Some symptoms were common: 73% reported sore or tired eyes when reading and 40% reported four to 12 headaches a year. One hundred of the subjects chose an overlay as improving their immediate perception of text. These subjects were significantly more likely to report perceptual distortions and visual discomfort on viewing text than subjects who did not choose an overlay. The 100 subjects read 3.8% faster with the overlay than without any overlay (p < 0.00001), whereas the 13 subjects who did not choose an overlay read 1.7% slower with a placebo overlay than without (p = 0.37). Of the subjects who chose an overlay, 38% read more than 5% faster with the overlay and 2% read more than 25% faster. These results are comparable with those obtained for children. We conclude that Meares-Irlen Syndrome is likely to be as common in adults as it is in children.","['Evans, Bruce J W', 'Joseph, Florence']","['Evans BJ', 'Joseph F']","['Institute of Optometry, Newington Causeway, London, UK. bruce.evans@virgin.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2002/12/13 04:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/12/13 04:00'],"['2002/12/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00071.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2002 Nov;22(6):535-45. doi: 10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00071.x.,,,20030106,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Filtration/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Perceptual Distortion/physiology', 'Psychological Tests', '*Reading', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Visual Perception/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Six female students fixed optical outward-shift stimuli for accommodation during 2 min immediately after 15 min of a sustained task on a 3-D display. Before and after the trial, their ocular functions were measured and their subjective symptoms were assessed. The outward-shift stimuli were applied by moving the targets of scenery images from far to near and near to far repetitively at around both eyes' far point position. As a control, stationary targets at the position of 0 D were used instead of moving targets. The same experiment was repeated twice for each subject. RESULTS: In the first experiment, there were significant changes in the accommodative contraction time, the accommodation lag, and the myopic shift, and the subjective symptoms of ""eyestrain"" and ""eye dryness"" in the control group, but in the stimulus group there were only increases of the complaint of ""eyestrain"". In the second experiment, the changed items were the contraction time and the complaints of ""eyestrain"" and ""eye dryness"" in both groups. The outward-shift stimuli caused a tendency in the far point to shift outward in the first experiment, and there was a statistically significant inward shift in the second experiment. CONCLUSION: From these results, it is suggested that the outward-shift stimuli for accommodation are effective in relieving eyestrain following the deterioration of ocular functions except when the far point is shifted inward.","['Iwasaki, Tsuneto', 'Tawara, Akihiko', 'Miyake, Nobuyuki']","['Iwasaki T', 'Tawara A', 'Miyake N']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan. 1-1 Iseigaoka Yahatanishi-ku Kitakyushu 807-8555, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,,,,2002/11/08 04:00,2003/02/26 04:00,['2002/11/08 04:00'],"['2002/11/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/08 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2002 Oct;106(10):634-41.,,,20030225,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Photic Stimulation/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of task parameters.",53-63,,"Antisaccade performance was investigated in a sample of 2,006 young males as part of a large epidemiological study investigating psychosis proneness. This report summarizes the effects of task parameters on performance using a sample of 55,678 antisaccade trials collected from a subpopulation of 947 individuals. Neither the amplitude nor the latency of an error prosaccade in the antisaccade task was correlated with the latency of the ensuing corrective antisaccade that almost always followed an error. However, the latency of the corrective antisaccade decreased with increasing stimulus distance. Concerning the effects of specific task parameters, trials with stimuli closer to the central fixation point and trials preceded by shorter fixation intervals resulted in more errors and longer latencies for the antisaccades. Finally, there were learning and fatigue effects reflected mainly in the error rate, which was greater at the beginning and at the end of the 5-min task. We used a model to predict whether an error or a correct antisaccade would follow a particular trial. All task parameters were significant predictors of the trial outcome but their power was negligible. However, when modeled alone, response latency of the first movement predicted 40% of errors. In particular, the smaller this latency was, the higher the probability of an error.

This may then be used to identify the possible origin of asthenopia and other ocular problems which occur whilst viewing such displays. METHODS: Subjects viewed a 3-D display through an image splitter. Video recordings of ocular responses (pupil diameter, vergence and accommodation) were made with a commercially available video refraction unit at a distance of 1.2 m from the subject. Continuous recordings were made whilst a step-wise disparity of up to 2.6 degrees was introduced between the targets presented to the two eyes, but the accommodative stimulus remained unchanged. Image analysis from the recordings was carried out on a personal computer. RESULTS: Results showed various complex patterns of response, with the accommodation and vergence recorded reflecting the effect of stimulus conflict. Difficulty in fusional convergence was recorded when disparity was large, and the recordings reflected the subjects' comments. CONCLUSION: The video refraction method is a useful tool for studying the dynamic behaviour of the near triad.","['Ukai, Kazuhiko', 'Kato, Yumi']","['Ukai K', 'Kato Y']","['Faculty of Social and Information Sciences, Nihon Fukushi University, Handa, Aichi, Japan. ukai@waseda.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00061.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2002 Sep;22(5):385-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00061.x.,,,20021017,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/physiopathology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Convergence, Ocular', '*Eye Movements', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Pupil/physiology', '*Refraction, Ocular', 'Videotape Recording', 'Vision Disparity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The 41 subjects were divided into 4 groups according to the type of correction. Near point of accommodation, accommodative relaxation, and contraction times were measured with an accommodo-polyrecorder before and after a stereoscopic visual load, and 15 min and 30 min after a rest. The subjective symptoms were assessed by a 7-point rating questionnaire at the same time as the measurements. RESULTS: After 15 min of sustained visual load, the near point of accommodation was prolonged significantly in the groups without correction and with soft contact lenses(SCL), and accommodative contraction and relaxation times were significant delayed in the groups without correction, with hard contact lenses(HCL), and with SCL but not in the group with spectacles. These changed values of accommodation returned to their previous value following the rest. Significant increase in the rating questionnaire was found in the subjective symptoms of ""eyestrain"", ""eye heaviness"", ""clouding"", ""eye dryness"" and ""irritation of eyes"" after loading in the groups without correction, with HCL, and with SCL. In the spectacle group, there was no significant change in the subjective symptoms of ""clouding"" and ""eye dryness"".

METHODS: Twenty-two subjects performed text-based tasks on five displays: monocular virtual, binocular head-mounted virtual, hard copy, flat panel, and a small format portable display. Outcome measures included performance speed, symptoms, visual acuity, and heterophoria. In a second experiment, subjects performed a proscribed routine of head and body movements designed to elicit motion-related symptoms. RESULTS: Performance speed on monocular virtual was generally comparable with performances on flat panel and hard copy. Overall, performance speeds on the binocular virtual display were about 5% slower than normalized performances, 6.75% slower compared with the traditional flat panel and hard copy displays. Symptoms of eyestrain and blurry vision were significantly higher on monocular virtual than on other displays. No significant changes in visual acuity or heterophoria occurred with any of the displays. Motion-related symptoms with the head mounted near-eye display were not significantly different than with other displays tested. CONCLUSIONS: Performance and comfort on the near-eye displays in this study was more similar to traditional displays than in many previous studies with head mounted displays. This is likely due to lack of task movement, partial instead of full immersion, better display resolution, and concordance of the accommodative and vergence stimuli.","['Sheedy, James', 'Bergstrom, Neil']","['Sheedy J', 'Bergstrom N']","['The Ohio State University, College of Optometry, Columbus 43210, USA. sheedy.2@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,2002/05/31 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/05/31 10:00'],"['2002/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['00006324-200205000-00010 [pii]', '10.1097/00006324-200205000-00010 [doi]']",ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 2002 May;79(5):306-12. doi: 10.1097/00006324-200205000-00010.,,,20021113,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', 'Data Display', 'Equipment Design', 'Humans', '*User-Computer Interface', 'Vision Disorders/etiology', 'Vision, Binocular', 'Vision, Monocular', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reaction consists of a deviation from the orthovergence position. Binocular vision causes a continuous calibration of the vergence position. This ""orthophorisation"" explains that in most persons, heterophoria differs only slightly from zero. Nevertheless, a small heterophoria is common (70-80% of the population). The need to compensate for heterophoria by sensory-motor fusion can cause asthenopic complaints, such as headaches with prolonged reading. Since a variety of other defects can lead to similar symptoms, a causal relationship with heterophoria can be assumed only after a thorough differential diagnosis. Prism spectacles or eye muscle surgery for heterophoria should be recommended only after prism trials in free space, which include yoked prisms as a placebo control. Heterophoria should be distinguished from ""Winkelfehlsichtigkeit"", which is a deviation from orthoposition that results from the ""measuring and correcting methodology after H.-J. Haase"" (MKH) and is based on the idea that fixation disparity, a minute deviation from orthovergence position, indicates an inability to overcome a larger ""vergence angle at rest"". Objective recordings have, however, revealed that the subjective tests with stereo cues applied in the MKH can mislead to the assumption of a fixation disparity although both eyes are aligned exactly to the fixation point. A trial conducted in the Netherlands concerning the therapy of asthenopic complaints showed no statistically significant advantage of prism spectacles determined with the MKH over conventional spectacles.","['Kommerell, G', 'Kromeier, M']","['Kommerell G', 'Kromeier M']","['Abt.

These subjects carried out the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (which assesses visual rather than linguistic factors) under two conditions: with their chosen coloured overlay and with a control filter. Steps were taken to ensure that a strong placebo effect was associated with the control overlay and, when asked which they preferred, subjects were not significantly more likely to prefer their coloured overlay than the control filter (p=0.11). Nonetheless, the rate of reading was significantly faster with the coloured overlay than with the control (p=0.0019).

METHODS: 16 eyes of 8 myopia cases whose muscular asthenopia was corrected by subjectively accepted triangular prism after PRK with vision more than 0.8 were followed up for 6-14 months. On the basis of data provided by the pre-PRK, post-PRK and their difference corneal topography, we calculated the real corrected corneal diopter (D) with the Holladay formula and measured the ablating eccentricity (h) and its direction. According to the formula delta approximately Dh, the prism effective value (delta) caused by the eccentric ablation was computed and compared with objectively accepted triangular prism. RESULTS: The subjectively accepted prism was similar to values calculated from the formula. Their mean difference is 0.10 +/- 0.25. The direction of the subjectively accepted prism was in the direction of ablation deviation. CONCLUSIONS: Eccentric ablation was the chief cause of post-PRK muscular visual asthenopia. The triangular prism effective value from eccentric ablation may be estimated by the formula delta approximately Dh. We must pay attention to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of post-PRK muscular asthenopia.","['Wu, G', 'Xie, L', 'Yao, Z']","['Wu G', 'Xie L', 'Yao Z']","['Institute of Ophthalmology, Shandong Academy of Medical Science, Qingdao 266071, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,,,2002/01/10 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2002/01/10 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2001 Feb;114(2):167-9.,,,20020213,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology/*therapy', 'Corneal Topography', 'Fixation, Ocular', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lasers, Excimer', 'Myopia/surgery', '*Photorefractive Keratectomy/adverse effects', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: The spectral power of the high frequency component of the accommodative microfluctuation (spectral power of HFC) differs according to the constrictive degree of the accommodation. In this paper, we expatiated upon our previously reported analyzing processes of the spectral power of HFC, and we investigated the relationship between normal subjects and subjects with asthenopia. METHOD: The accommodative microfluctuation were recorded when the subjects were looking at a stable target. The waves of the accommodative microfluctuation were analyzed by FFT. RESULTS: The spectral power of HFC for the distant target was 50-60 in the subjects with normal vision, but it was higher in the subjects with asthenopia. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the ciliary muscle was also actively working in asthenopia caused by accommodative spasm even if the patient was looking at a distant target.","['Kajita, M', 'Ono, M', 'Suzuki, S', 'Kato, K']","['Kajita M', 'Ono M', 'Suzuki S', 'Kato K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima City, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Fukushima J Med Sci,Fukushima journal of medical science,0374626,IM,,,,2002/01/05 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2002/01/05 10:00'],"['2002/01/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.5387/fms.47.13 [doi]'],ppublish,Fukushima J Med Sci. 2001 Jun;47(1):13-20. doi: 10.5387/fms.47.13.,,,20020502,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Spasm/*complications']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a task lamp in front, when looking at a document a viewer sees two images, the document itself and specular glare, which is the reflected image of the light source. Specular glare or veiling reflection causes eye discomfort, makes it difficult to read a document and has been thought to contribute to eyestrain. This paper analyzes the application of polarized lighting for this specific situation. The use of a linear polarized light source helps to minimize specular glare by darkening the reflected image of the light source on the document. The performance and predictive optimization of the use of polarized lighting in this situation is investigated according to female and male viewer height demographics. Theoretical predictions and light measurement analysis of specular glare reduction are compared with empirical results from testing on a panel of humans on semi-gloss finish and matte finish papers. This study shows that with the right alteration of a polarized light source position, specular glare may be significantly reduced, and correlations exist between the theory, empirical measurements and the human response to specular glare reduction.","['Japuntich, D A']",['Japuntich DA'],"['Office Supplies Division, Office Ergonomics and Cleaning Systems, 3M Company, 3M Center, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000, USA. dajapuntich@mmm.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Appl Ergon,Applied ergonomics,0261412,IM,,,,2001/09/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0003687001000205 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-6870(01)00020-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Ergon. 2001 Oct;32(5):485-99. doi: 10.1016/s0003-6870(01)00020-5.,,,20020102,,,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Asthenopia/*prevention & control', '*Ergonomics', 'Female', '*Glare', 'Humans', 'Interior Design and Furnishings', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Task Performance and Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixteen eyes of eight myopic patients whose muscular asthenopia was corrected by subjectively accepted spectacle prism after PRK, with visual acuity better than 0.8, were followed for 6 to 14 months. On the basis of preoperative and post-operative data and corneal topography, we calculated the total corrected corneal power using the Holladay formula and then measured the ablation eccentricity (h, millimeters) and its direction. According to the formula delta approximately equals Dh, the prism effective value (delta) caused by the eccentric ablation was computed and compared with the objectively accepted spectacle prism. RESULTS: The subjectively accepted spectacle prisms were similar to calculated values from the formula. Mean difference was 0.10 +/- 0.25delta. The direction of the subjectively accepted prism was in the direction of the ablation deviation. CONCLUSIONS: Eccentric ablation is an important cause of muscular visual asthenopia after PRK. The asthenopia may be corrected by spectacle prism. The spectacle prism value may be estimated by the formula delta approximately equals Dh.","['Wu, G', 'Xie, L', 'Yao, Z']","['Wu G', 'Xie L', 'Yao Z']","[""Institute of Ophthalmology, Shandong Academy of Medical Science, Qingdao, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Refract Surg,"Journal of refractive surgery (Thorofare, N.J. : 1995)",9505927,IM,,,,2001/06/01 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Refract Surg. 2001 May-Jun;17(3):380-2.,,,20011004,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/therapy', 'Astigmatism/*etiology/therapy', 'Cornea/surgery', 'Corneal Topography', 'Diplopia/etiology/therapy', 'Eyeglasses', 'Humans', 'Lasers, Excimer', 'Myopia/surgery', 'Photorefractive Keratectomy/*adverse effects', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Refract Surg 2001 Sep-Oct;17(5):498']

The duration and the amplitude of the EMG of the orbicularis ocular muscle on the right side and the EOG of the vertical direction to the eyelid were measured for 10 subjects who participated in a figure task consisting of the addition of single-digit numbers on a VDT work or a work with a hard-copy. The mean values of the duration and the amplitude of the EMG and the EOG were evaluated by the averaging of 10 waveforms of the spontaneous blinks for all subjects. The time lag from the EMG to the EOG in the process of the generation of spontaneous blinks was also analyzed. These five parameters were evaluated during the work time. The mean values for the duration of the EMG increased gradually during the work time, but the amplitude did not show significant difference between the prework and a work time. There was no significant change of the duration of the EOG, but the mean amplitude of the EOG decreased as the work time progressed, and the time lag significantly extended. The blinks frequency increased relatively when using a VDT. The rate of fluctuation for these parameters was higher during use of a VDT than use of a hard-copy. The time lag at five hours of VDT work was extended by 90% based on the value at the pre-work. The symptoms of general fatigue and fatigue of the eyes increased linearly during the VDT work for six hours. The results indicated a significant correlation between the objective parameters for the activity of the spontaneous blinks, i.e., duration and amplitude of EMG and EOG, and the time lag between EMG and EOG, and the subjective feeling was recognized in the time course of the task. These experimental results suggested that the parameters regarding the EMG and the EOG for the spontaneous blinks were effective indices for assessing visual fatigue during prolonged VDT work.","['Kaneko, K', 'Sakamoto, K']","['Kaneko K', 'Sakamoto K']","['Department of Communications and Systems, The University of Electro-Communications, Chofu City, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Percept Mot Skills,Perceptual and motor skills,0401131,IM,,,,2001/04/27 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/04/27 10:00'],"['2001/04/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2466/pms.2001.92.1.234 [doi]'],ppublish,Percept Mot Skills. 2001 Feb;92(1):234-50. doi: 10.2466/pms.2001.92.1.234.,,,20011204,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Blinking/*physiology', '*Computers', 'Electrooculography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Time Factors', 'Visual Perception/*physiology', '*Work']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Haase (MKH) was compared to that of glasses prescribed by conventional orthoptic examination. Nine pairs of MKH-optometrists and orthoptists recruited patients who primarily presented with asthenopia, and each prescribed the patient (prism-)glasses. A questionnaire for asthenopia was developed that rated headache and tired eyes as 0-7 days per week and none-light-medium-severe, respectively. Light sensitivity, problems with focusing, near-work problems and burning eyes were each rated as: never-occasionally-often-always. A patient was eligible if he scored 'medium', 'often' or '5 days a week' twice; or 'medium' (etc.) once and 'light' (etc.) twice. Controls, in contrast to the patients, typically answered 'none' or 'never' to half of the complaints, but 37% of them would have passed the admission criteria. Among other criteria were: 18 to 40 years of age, horizontal angle < 4 degrees, vertical < 1.7 degrees, acuity > or = 0.8, stereopsis threshold disparity < 120"". Seventy-two patients fulfilled all criteria and returned sufficient questionnaires. They wore the first glasses for six weeks, were without glasses for two weeks, and then wore the second glasses for six weeks. At the start, halfway and at the end of each 6-week period, questionnaires were filled out; 97% were returned. Only 19 of the orthoptists' glasses contained prisms (14 horizontal, 5 vertical; horizontal average of all glasses 0.49 PD, vertical 0.05 PD). Five of the orthoptists' glasses were plano. All MKH glasses contained prisms, 53 of 72 both horizontal and vertical, 18 only horizontal and one only vertical (horizontal average of all glasses 2.83 PD, vertical 0.79 PD). The starting levels of complaints were high and both glasses improved complaints dramatically. The starting levels were lower, but not significantly, in the second 6-week period and improvement was less outspoken. Because of these differences, the two periods had to be evaluated separately. The primary outcome of the study was defined as the difference between the effect of the MKH glasses and that of the orthoptists' glasses in the first and second 6-week periods. For problems with focusing, in the first 6-week period, and for tired eyes, in the second 6-week period, the difference exceeded the difference that had been defined as clinically significant (one day per week less headache or half the distance light-medium or half the distance occasionally-often), but it did not reach statistical significance. The statistical power was approximately 0.7 for demonstrating this clinically significant difference. Statistical significance was not reached in multivariate repeated measure ANOVA either. Forty-four patients preferred to keep the MKH glasses, 25 the orthoptists' glasses, including one plano. It is striking that 25% of the patients did not prefer the glasses that, according to the questionnaire, improved their complaints the most. A year after the study, the questionnaire was sent again to all patients: The levels of complaints after a year were similar to those at the end of the second 6-week period, whether they had preferred the MKH or the orthoptists' glasses, and were similar to the levels in controls. The most conspicuous finding was that both glasses improved the complaints dramatically. Apart from the prisms, other reasons could be: spherical and cylindrical correction, improved wearing comfort of the frame, placebo effect, Hawthorne effect and regression to the mean.","['Simonsz, H J', 'van Els, J', 'Ruijter, J M', 'Bakker, D', 'Spekreijse, H']","['Simonsz HJ', 'van Els J', 'Ruijter JM', 'Bakker D', 'Spekreijse H']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Dijkzigt, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. simonsz@compuserve.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Strabismus,Strabismus,9310896,IM,,,,2001/03/23 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/03/23 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1076/stra.9.1.17.709 [doi]'],ppublish,Strabismus. 2001 Mar;9(1):17-27. doi: 10.1076/stra.9.1.17.709.,,,20010705,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*therapy', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', '*Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Optometry/methods', 'Orthoptics/methods', '*Prescriptions', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Out of a population of 385 bank workers, a group of 212 subjects without organic visual disturbances (as determined by ophthalmological examination) who share a work environment and job duties was selected. Three questionnaires were administered to these subjects: (a) the NIOSH job stress questionnaire; (b) a questionnaire investigating subjective discomfort related to environmental and lighting conditions of the workplace; (c) a questionnaire on the existence of oculovisual disturbances. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were performed to examine for the presence of predictors of asthenopia. RESULTS: Social support, group conflict, self esteem, work satisfaction, and underuse of skills were found to be predictors of visual complaints; social support played a part also as a moderating factor in the stress and strain model; this model accounted for 30% of the variance. Subjective environmental factors, although in some cases significantly correlated with asthenopia, were not found to be strong predictors of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Some part of the complaints about visual health reported by VDT workers are likely indirect expressions of psychological discomfort related to working conditions.","['Mocci, F', 'Serra, A', 'Corrias, G A']","['Mocci F', 'Serra A', 'Corrias GA']","['Occupational Medicine Institute, University of Sassari, Via Matteotti 58, 07100 Sassari, Italy. mocci@ssmain.uniss.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,,,,2001/03/14 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/14 10:00'],"['2001/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.58.4.267 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2001 Apr;58(4):267-71. doi: 10.1136/oem.58.4.267.,,,20010329,,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/psychology', '*Commerce', '*Computer Terminals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology/psychology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Self Concept', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Support', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Workload']",PMC1740121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We compared vergence adaptation in 18 children and 18 young adult subjects by assessing tonic vergence (TV) before and immediately after a period of sustained near fixation, by measuring heterophoria with a synoptophore through 0.5 mm binocular pinholes. Adaptation was induced by a reading task at 15 cm for a continuous 5 minute period. RESULTS: Mean pre-task TV values of 0.70 MA (Meter Angles) and 0.20 MA were observed for the children and young adults, respectively (p = 0.08). The initial mean vergence adaptation for children and adults was +0.45 MA and +0.11 MA, respectively (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The greater vergence adaptation observed in children may impact upon the clinical assessment of their binocular vision, especially heterophoria measurement which may require longer periods of dissociation than previously recommended, and might also ultimately be partly responsible for the predominant development of esodeviations during childhood","['Wong, L C', 'Rosenfield, M', 'Wong, N N']","['Wong LC', 'Rosenfield M', 'Wong NN']","['State University of New York, State College of Optometry, New York, New York 10036, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Binocul Vis Strabismus Q,Binocular vision & strabismus quarterly,9607281,IM,,,,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Binocul Vis Strabismus Q. 2001;16(1):29-34.,,,20010419,,,"['Adaptation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Convergence, Ocular/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Orthoptics/methods', 'Strabismus/*physiopathology', 'Vision Tests', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvement of such subjective conditions after a regimen of therapy is often difficult to objectively quantify. The goal of this study was to verify the test-re-test reliability of a new clinical survey instrument, the College of Optometrists in Vision Development (COVD) Quality of Life Outcomes Assessment, which allows the analysis of symptoms data. METHODS: The first-year class of optometry students at the Oklahoma College of Optometry at Northeastern State University were administered the instrument in a group setting on two different occasions, two weeks apart. Nineteen students completed both test and re-test. Statistical analysis by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and paired t test were performed. RESULTS: Each subject reported some of the 30 symptoms on both test and re-test. The instrument was found to be reliable. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Analysis showed no significant differences in test-retest scores, either pooled or item-by-item. A paired t-test group and item analysis were insignificantly different between scores. Spearman's rho correlation for test-retest of each subject was 0.878. Eighty-nine percent (17 of 19) scored insignificantly different between administrations. Ninety percent of the items (27 of 30) were found to vary insignificantly between the two administrations. CONCLUSIONS: The COVD Quality of Life Outcomes Assessment is a reliable tool to measure changes in symptoms on the basis of optometric intervention--specifically, vision therapy.","['Maples, W C']",['Maples WC'],"['Northeastern State University College of Optometry, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Optometry,"Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)",100912421,IM,,,,2000/10/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Optometry. 2000 Sep;71(9):579-85.,,,20001026,,,"['Humans', 'Oklahoma', 'Optometry/*methods', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods', '*Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Students', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vision Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Vision Tests/*standards']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another aim of the study was whether flip lens-training increased accommodative facility, and to find out if it also had a positive effect on their asthenopia and related problems also in long term. Following the training period the accommodative facility and accommodative function significantly increased and two years after finishing the training period no child had regained any subjective symptoms and the objective findings were almost the same as at the end of facility training period. These results suggest that accommodative facility training is an efficient method built on loss of symptoms among children with accommodative infacility.","['Sterner, B', 'Abrahamsson, M', 'Sjostrom, A']","['Sterner B', 'Abrahamsson M', 'Sjostrom A']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Goteborg University, Molndal, Sweden. sterner@oft.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Doc Ophthalmol,Documenta ophthalmologica.

Results are based on data from 42 workers. They indicated that discomfort in several areas of the body, and eyestrain, were significantly lower under the supplementary than under the conventional schedule. While symptoms increased from pre- to post-work periods under both schedules, the magnitude of the increases was significantly less under the supplementary schedule. In addition, increases in discomfort of the right forearm, wrist and hand over the course of the work week under the conventional schedule were eliminated under the supplementary schedule.

In addition, clinical measurements were obtained periodically at different times of the day for various binocular motor functions, including near point of convergence, phoria, fusional and accommodative amplitudes, and relative accommodation. The disease adversely affected all accommodative and vergence findings, with fatigue being the primary disturbance. The therapeutic administration of pyridostigmine improved static measurements of accommodation and vergence and reduced asthenopia.

Visual symptoms and headaches were common. 48% of patients were given a conventional optometric intervention (spectacles, orthoptic exercises) and 50% were issued with coloured filters, usually for a trial period. 40% of those who were given orthoptic exercises were later issued with coloured overlays. 32% of those who were issued with coloured overlays were ultimately prescribed Precision Tinted lenses. Approximately half the sample were telephoned more than a year after the last clinical appointment. More than 70% of those who were prescribed Precision Tints were still wearing them daily, and results for this intervention compared favourably with data for non-tinted spectacles. The data suggest that many people with SpLD need optometric care and that the optometrist needs to be skilled in orthoptic techniques and cognisant of recent research on coloured filters.","['Evans, B J', 'Patel, R', 'Wilkins, A J', 'Lightstone, A', 'Eperjesi, F', 'Speedwell, L', 'Duffy, J']","['Evans BJ', 'Patel R', 'Wilkins AJ', 'Lightstone A', 'Eperjesi F', 'Speedwell L', 'Duffy J']","['Institute of Optometry, London, UK. bruce.evans@virgin.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,2000/04/18 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/04/18 09:00'],"['2000/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0275540899000216 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1475-1313.1999.00465.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 1999 Nov;19(6):454-66. doi: 10.1046/j.1475-1313.1999.00465.x.,,,20000424,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Color Therapy', 'Dyslexia/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Filtration/instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Optometry', 'Patient Compliance', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Syndrome', 'Visual Perception/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standard task consisted of suture closure of 60 mm enterotomies made in porcine small bowel with continuous seromuscular 3/0 Polysorb. Ten experienced surgeons participated in the study. The imaging systems were Storz (2-D), Welch Allyn (3-D), and Zeiss (as both 2-D and 3-D). Each surgeon performed two tasks with each modality in a random sequence.

In addition, the participating surgeons assigned subjective scores on the image quality and the adverse effects of the imaging systems. There was no significant difference in the execution time, leakage pressure, and suture placement score among the various imaging modalities. Depth perception was rated as similar with 2-D and 3-D imaging. Surgeons experienced visual strain with the three systems, but it was rated higher with 3-D imaging.

Visual fatigue was measured both by a subjective evaluation of different visual complaints (asthenopic symptoms) and by objective measurements of changes in the following visual functions: accommodation, convergence, habitual horizontal phoria, critical fusional frequency (CFF), and visual acuity. The same experiments were done for CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and LCD TFT (Liquid Crystal Display with Thin Film Transistor) screens. The results of the study have shown that there was no significant influence of the value of surrounding luminance on the asthenopic symptoms for either type of screen. A general tendency towards bigger visual complaints for LCD TFT than for CRT participants was found. An objective evaluation of visual fatigue demonstrated a tendency towards bigger changes in visual functions with an increase of surrounding luminance for both screens.

Respondents numbered 1237 and 836 people when surveys were conducted at one and three years after the sarin incident, respectively. Numbers of persons with symptoms of sarin toxicity were compared between sarin victims and non-victims. Of the respondents, 58 and 46 people had symptoms associated with sarin such as fatigue, asthenia, shoulder stiffness, asthenopia and blurred vision at both points of the survey, respectively. The prevalences were low; some complained of insomnia, had bad dreams, difficulty in smoking, husky voice, slight fever and palpitation. The victims who had symptoms one year after the incident had a lower erythrocyte cholinesterase activity than did those who did not have symptoms at the early stage; such persons lived in an area with a 500 meter long axis north east from the sarin release site. The three-year cohort study clearly showed that the odds ratios of almost all of the symptoms were high in the sarin-exposed group, suggesting a positive relationship between symptoms and grades of exposure to sarin. These results suggest that symptoms reported by many victims of the sarin incident are thought to be sequelae related to sarin exposure.","['Nakajima, T', 'Ohta, S', 'Fukushima, Y', 'Yanagisawa, N']","['Nakajima T', 'Ohta S', 'Fukushima Y', 'Yanagisawa N']","['Department of Hygiene, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Nagano, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Epidemiol,Journal of epidemiology,9607688,IM,,,,2000/01/05 00:00,2000/01/05 00:01,['2000/01/05 00:00'],"['2000/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '2000/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2188/jea.9.337 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol. 1999 Nov;9(5):337-43. doi: 10.2188/jea.9.337.,,,20000118,"['0 (Chemical Warfare Agents)', '0 (Cholinesterase Inhibitors)', 'B4XG72QGFM (Sarin)']",,"['Adult', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/chemically induced', 'Asthenia/chemically induced', 'Asthenopia/chemically induced', 'Chemical Warfare Agents/*adverse effects/poisoning', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/poisoning', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dreams', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Joint Diseases/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Sarin/*adverse effects/poisoning', 'Shoulder Joint/drug effects', 'Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/chemically induced', 'Smoking/physiopathology', 'Vision Disorders/chemically induced', 'Voice Disorders/chemically induced']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A projection space eikonometer study.,183-90,,"PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of aniseikonia and aniseikonic symptoms in pseudophakia (intraocular lens implantation after cataract extraction). METHOD: Aniseikonia, stereoacuity, and clinical symptoms were evaluated in patients with unilateral and bilateral pseudophakia. Aniseikonia was determined with the Essilor projection space eikonometer. Eight-seven cases were studied, fifty-four of unilateral pseudophakia and thirty-three of bilateral pseudophakia. Nine of the 87 patients had insufficient stereopsis to be examined or measured for aniseikonia with the Essilor instrument, and were studied with the ""Double-D"", a two dimensional ""direct comparison eikonometer"" device programmed and viewed on a computer. Stereoacuity was determined with the Titmus Stereo Test. RESULTS: Thirty-five (40.2%) of all pseudophakes had ophthalmic complaints referable to aniseikonia. The mean aniseikonia in the unilateral pseudophakia group was 4.1%, SD=3.41, while the mean aniseikonia in the bilateral group was 3.2%, SD=2.6. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic aniseikonia is common in pseudophakia. Unilateral pseudophakia has the higher degrees of aniseikonia, and is at a greater risk of loss of binocularity and of asthenopia.","['Kramer, P W', 'Lubkin, V', 'Pavlica, M', 'Covin, R']","['Kramer PW', 'Lubkin V', 'Pavlica M', 'Covin R']","['The Aborn Eye Research Center, The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, New York, New York 10003, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Binocul Vis Strabismus Q,Binocular vision & strabismus quarterly,9607281,IM,,,,1999/11/11 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['1999/11/11 09:00'],"['1999/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Binocul Vis Strabismus Q. 1999;14(3):183-90.,,,19991206,,['Binocul Vis Strabismus Q. 1999;14(4):263.

METHODS: Sixty adult males over the age of 40 years (median age, 65 years) with convergence insufficiency were divided into three treatment groups: office-based vision therapy with supplementary home therapy, home therapy only, and a control group. RESULTS: Vision therapy was successful in 61.9% of patients who received in-office plus home therapy, in 30% of patients who received home therapy only, and in 10.5% of the control group. The success rate for patients who received active in-office vision therapy supplemented with home procedures was significantly greater than that for controls. Home therapy alone was less successful than in-office therapy. The success rate obtained with home therapy alone was not significantly greater than that demonstrated by controls. CONCLUSIONS: Vision therapy is effective in eliminating asthenopia and improving convergence function in adult patients.

During the task participants visually searched enlarged images of contact lenses for six different types of defects. Lens images were presented at a constant visual angle (17.5 degrees) on a CRT. Inspection performance varied significantly across the two viewing distances: participants spent on average more than twice as much time inspecting individual lenses in the near condition (mean = 18.32 s lens(-1)) than in the far condition (mean = 7.25 s lens(-1)). Participants also reported greater visual fatigue in the near condition than in the far condition. At both viewing distances, participants who experienced relatively large inward shifts in dark vergence also tended to be slow inspectors. Neither inspection performance nor measures of fatigue were related to dark focus. These results support existing evidence against the use of near viewing distances and suggest that an oculomotor mechanism links inspection performance and visual fatigue to viewing distance.","['Jebaraj, D', 'Tyrrell, R A', 'Gramopadhye, A K']","['Jebaraj D', 'Tyrrell RA', 'Gramopadhye AK']","['Department of Industrial Engineering, Clemson University, SC 29634-0920, USA. daniel@stingray.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Appl Ergon,Applied ergonomics,0261412,IM S,,,,1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003687098000258 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-6870(98)00025-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Ergon. 1999 Jun;30(3):223-8. doi: 10.1016/s0003-6870(98)00025-8.,,,19990629,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Darkness', '*Ergonomics', 'Humans', 'Regression Analysis', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same measurement techniques, excluding pupil diameter and eye movement velocity, were compared by extending the task time from 20 to 60 min with the same VDT tasks to test for possible improvement in sensitivity. The results indicated that sensitivities of accommodation power, visual acuity, and CFF were greatly improved by a longer task period, but these 3 measurement techniques did not distinguish among tasks. Pupil diameter, eye movement velocity, and subjective rating of visual fatigue were sensitive in differentiating tracking from reading and monitoring tasks. Eye movement velocity and subjective rating were sensitive to the changes in target velocity of the tracking task. Although task performance was not directly comparable to other measurement techniques, it helped to ensure that participants maintained the same performance level by devoting more resources to the high-load conditions.

Experiment 1 examined the effects of 2 CRT conditions (resolutions of 60 and 120 dots per inch [dpi]) and a paper control condition (255 dpi) on proofreading speed and accuracy. The results showed that reading performance was significantly better in the paper condition than in the 2 CRT conditions. Experiment 2 examined the effects of 3 different CRT resolutions (62, 69, and 89 dpi) on eye movement parameters (fixation duration and number of fixations) in a visual search task. Further, search reaction times (RTs) and observers' ratings of visual fatigue were analyzed. RTs and fixation durations were significantly increased in the low-resolution condition (62 dpi) as compared with the high-resolution condition (89 dpi). The significant interaction between display resolution and time both for search RTs and fixation durations was taken as evidence for stronger fatigue in the low-resolution conditions. Additionally, the extent of visual fatigue correlates both with search RTs and eye movement parameters. This finding gives rise to the assumption that observers' responsiveness to effects of display resolution in terms of visual fatigue differs markedly.

It was found that the group that suffered severe visual discomfort took significantly longer than other groups to perform the task, with interference greatest with presentation of the square-wave-like pattern. This supports the prediction of greatest distraction of visual attention from the local target elements with presentation of the pattern structure inducing greatest visual discomfort. In experiment 3, the internal pattern components were manipulated and task difficulty reduced. A no-interference and two interference patterns, one with a global characteristic only and the second made up of distracting line elements, containing global and local components were used. The global pattern structure produced interference effects on the visual-search task.

The findings from the two examinations were correlated to VDU work (hours daily and years of VDU work), age and sex. RESULTS: Changes in the refractive state seemed to be mainly age-related. There was a slight tendency toward hyperopia (imbalance of latent hyperopia). CONCLUSIONS: In the analysis of ocular motility, the results show no worsening capable of causing a definitive change from heterophoria to heterotropia. Heterophoric subjects, however, tend to improve both with regular office work and with additional VDU activity.","['Grignolo, F M', 'Di Bari, A', 'Bellan, B Jr', 'Camerino, L', 'Maina, G']","['Grignolo FM', 'Di Bari A', 'Bellan B Jr', 'Camerino L', 'Maina G']","['II Eye Clinic, Torino University, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Eur J Ophthalmol,European journal of ophthalmology,9110772,IM,,,,1998/07/23 02:02,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/07/23 02:02'],"['1998/07/23 02:02 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/07/23 02:02 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Ophthalmol. 1998 Apr-Jun;8(2):76-80.,,,19980918,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Asthenopia/etiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Eye Movements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Refractive Errors/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Strabismus/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The change from far to near viewing distance produced a larger increase in eyestrain when the VDUs were at eye level. High screens resulted in greater eyestrain than low screens, as shown by correlations over subjects. When operators were free to adjust the most comfortable screen position, the group of 22 participants preferred viewing distances between 60 and 100 cm and vertical inclination of gaze direction between horizontal and -16 degrees downwards. However, within most subjects the range of preferred screen positions was much smaller. Between 3 days during a 1-month period the test-retest correlations of the preferred screen positions were highly significant, both for viewing distance and vertical gaze inclination. When operators were forced to work at a shorter distance than their preferred viewing distance they reported more visual strain. Thus, operators appear to prefer an individual adjustment of the screen relative to the eyes in order to avoid visual strain and discomfort at VDU work.","['Jaschinski, W', 'Heuer, H', 'Kylian, H']","['Jaschinski W', 'Heuer H', 'Kylian H']","['Institut fur Arbeitsphysiologie, Dortmund, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,,,,1998/07/23 00:00,1998/07/23 00:01,['1998/07/23 00:00'],"['1998/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/001401398186586 [doi]'],ppublish,Ergonomics. 1998 Jul;41(7):1034-49. doi: 10.1080/001401398186586.,,,19980806,,,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Asthenopia/*prevention & control', '*Computer Terminals', '*Ergonomics', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*prevention & control']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After therapy, there was marked reduction of symptoms and considerable improvement in clinical accommodative facility measures, as well as improvement in the objective findings.

CFFF was not changed. Wearing of eyeglasses with filters for 4 h of working at a display caused shifting of the nearest and most distant points of clear vision in comparison with the control group with the accommodation volume unchanged and preserved the high contrast sensitivity at the mean and low frequencies during the entire period of work. No changes in CFFF were noted.

Participants included 1743 people who answered the questionnaire at the first survey; those with symptoms were contacted for follow-up at four months and one year after the episode. The number of sarin victims were 471 persons. Muscarinic signs were common to all victims; nicotinic signs were only seen in severely affected victims. The geographical distribution of sarin victims was closely related to the direction of the wind. Three weeks after the intoxication, 129 victims still had some symptoms such as dysesthesia of the extremities. At that time, many victims had begun to experience asthenopia, which was even more frequent at four months. Although victims who felt sarin-related symptoms had decreased by a year, some still had symptoms such as asthenopia. Sarin released in a suburban area affected approximately 500 inhabitants living nearby; some still had symptoms a year after the intoxication.","['Nakajima, T', 'Ohta, S', 'Morita, H', 'Midorikawa, Y', 'Mimura, S', 'Yanagisawa, N']","['Nakajima T', 'Ohta S', 'Morita H', 'Midorikawa Y', 'Mimura S', 'Yanagisawa N']","['Department of Hygiene, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Epidemiol,Journal of epidemiology,9607688,IM,,,,1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2188/jea.8.33 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol. 1998 Mar;8(1):33-41. doi: 10.2188/jea.8.33.,,,19980609,['B4XG72QGFM (Sarin)'],,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Chemical Warfare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarin/*poisoning', 'Topography, Medical', 'Violence/*statistics & numerical data']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Epidemiol 1998 Jun;8(2):129']

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University-based referral practice in Edmonton. PATIENTS: A total of 222 patients (115 females and 107 males) aged 9 to 69 (mean 29) years who underwent strabismus surgery for various types of strabismus (as grouped by original diagnosis). All patients were followed for at least 6 weeks postoperatively. OUTCOME MEASURES: Previous surgery and deviation in prism dioptres (delta) (distance and near), sensory status (measured by the Titmus stereotest at near) and the presence of symptoms (diplopia, abnormal head posture or asthenopia), recorded preoperatively, 6 weeks postoperatively and at the last postoperative visit. RESULTS: The patients were followed for an average of 14 months postoperatively. At the last postoperative visit 187 patients (84%) were aligned to within 15 delta of orthotropia. Overall, 116 patients (52%) demonstrated some degree of stereopsis postoperatively, compared with 78 (35%) preoperatively. A total of 116 patients (52%) had symptoms preoperatively, including diplopia, abnormal head posture or asthenopia; 88 (76%) of the 116 had complete resolution of their symptoms. Six patients (4%) without diplopia preoperatively were found to have this symptom postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that most visually mature patients under-going strabismus surgery can expect functional benefits, including improvement of alignment, preservation and occasionally restoration of sensory fusion, and elimination of diplopia, abnormal head posture and asthenopia.","['Gill, M K', 'Drummond, G T']","['Gill MK', 'Drummond GT']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Alberta, Edmonton.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Can J Ophthalmol,Canadian journal of ophthalmology.

Pupillary oscillation is a well-established phenomenon that has a broadly spread frequency spectrum with an occasional component 'hippus' at approximately 0.2 Hz. A proportion of subjects (30 out of 100) showed hippus, a consistent oscillation of 0.22 Hz (SD = 0.03 Hz) in VDU workers, while only one out of 24 normal subjects showed this. Occurrence of pupillary hippus following near vision increased in VDU workers.

Measurements of viewing distance, viewing angle, head angle, neck angle and electromyogram (EMG) activities of the neck, shoulder and back muscles of visual display terminal (VDT) operators were compared at workstations using an FPD and a desktop personal computer (DPC). A notebook personal computer (NPC) with a 10.4 inches FPD, was used in this experiment. Each of 10 healthy subjects performed word processing tasks using both NPC and DPC workstations. Significant differences in the work posture while using the NPC and DPC were seen with viewing distance, viewing angle and head angle. The characteristic features of the work posture using the NPC were a remarkably short viewing distance and a forward inclination of the head. The value of integrated EMG (IEMG) of the neck muscle was greater while using the NPC than when using the DPC. These phenomena were caused by the structure of NPCs; most NPCs have a display and keyboard which cannot be separated and are not adjustable without tilt and swivel mechanisms. VDT devices that cannot be adjusted may potentially make operators assume a poor posture while working, which could cause visual and musculoskeletal disorders. To prevent visual and musculoskeletal problems using NPCs, a more upright head and neck position was recommended. The addition of a mechanism for adjustment of the height of an NPC display would allow a comfortable downward gaze without the loss of correct posture.","['Saito, S', 'Miyao, M', 'Kondo, T', 'Sakakibara, H', 'Toyoshima, H']","['Saito S', 'Miyao M', 'Kondo T', 'Sakakibara H', 'Toyoshima H']","['Department of Human Sciences, Aichi Mizuho College, Toyota, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Ind Health,Industrial health,2985065R,IM,,,,1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2486/indhealth.35.264 [doi]'],ppublish,Ind Health. 1997 Apr;35(2):264-70. doi: 10.2486/indhealth.35.264.,,,19970618,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Electromyography', 'Ergometry', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microcomputers', 'Muscle, Skeletal/physiology', '*Posture', 'Word Processing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been said, however, that the binocular picture system is more fatiguing to view than a conventional two-dimensional picture, much as the current television picture. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate quantitatively fatigue caused by binocular stereoscopic picture viewing, to clarify the basic characteristics of this type of picture. Various measurement methods of fatigue have been proposed, and that using the critical flicker frequency (CFF) has found wide use in measurement of mental fatigue and is easy to make. Actual measurement in this study used the CFF value obtained in a descending series of the method of limits, normalized to the value at the start of measurement for each observer, and the CFFs of all observers then averaged. It was found that the measurements produced stable and highly accurate results. CFFs of the observers of a current television picture and a binocular stereoscopic television picture were measured. It was found that the conventional television did not cause a statistically significant decrease in CFF--even over 1 h of viewing--but that the stereoscopic television did cause a significant CFF decrease within 30 min. It was also found that the CFF decreases are related to a subjective feeling of fatigue. From these results, it was concluded that CFF is an effective measure for objectively measuring the fatigue of television observers, including observers of binocular stereoscopic television. Also, the binocular stereoscopic television produced higher fatigue in observers than did the conventional television picture, but it was found that with respect to CFF viewing of around 30 min was allowable.","['Mitsuhashi, T']",['Mitsuhashi T'],"['NHK Science and Technical Research Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,,,,1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00140139608964554 [doi]'],ppublish,Ergonomics. 1996 Nov;39(11):1344-56. doi: 10.1080/00140139608964554.,,,19961230,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Asthenopia/psychology', 'Convergence, Ocular', '*Data Display', '*Depth Perception', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motion Perception', '*Pattern Recognition, Visual', 'Psychophysics', 'Sensory Thresholds', '*Television', 'Vision Disparity', '*Vision, Binocular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three experiments to study visual accommodation and task performance during stereographic vision were carried out in order to better understand the human response to virtual reality. Visual accommodation to stereograms on CRT was studied. Subjects could see the target on the CRT display binocularly through liquid crystal shutters. Accommodation to a stereogram with step changes in distance was tested first. As the second experiment, accommodation to a stereogram with gradual changes in distance, and comparison of ability to perform a colour photograph stereogram task were tested. Finally, accommodation and subject performance during a prolonged stereographic object task were observed for 30 min. A virtual 'gate' was formed at a position 1.2m from the subject. The virtual target moved forward and backward through this gate between the positions of 0.8m and 2.0m. The subjects were asked to focus on the target and press a button as it moved through the virtual gate. Subjective response to the task and the error between the position where the button was pressed and the gate was recorded. It was concluded that there are some people who exhibit large changes in accommodation while performing a stereographic task. There is a tendency to accommodate to a distance nearer than the baseline.

Several different tests for the measurement of astigmatism have been described in the literature, but there are few studies that have compared the results of various tests. METHODS: The results of three astigmatism tests performed on 40 subjects by two examiners were compared. Two of the tests, the Jackson cross cylinder (JCC) and the Humphriss immediate contrast (HIC), utilized distance targets; one test, the Pratt test, involved a near target. RESULTS: The mean differences between all tests were less than 0.25D. There was a slight tendency for higher cylinder power to be found on the Pratt test. The three tests agreed within +/- 0.25D on cylinder power 80 to 98 percent of the time and within 10 degrees of cylinder axis 85 to 98 percent of the time. Interexaminer reliability showed mean differences less than 0.12D for each of the three tests, agreement within +/- 0.25D on cylinder power 88 to 90 percent of the time and within 10 degrees on cylinder axis 85 to 93 percent of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that any of the three techniques could be substituted for another for astigmatism testing. On theoretical grounds, a binocular refraction method for cylinder axis determination, such as the HIC, is advisable for patients with cyclophorias and significant amounts of astigmatism. The results showed good reliability for each of the three methods.","['Johnson, B L', 'Edwards, J S', 'Goss, D A', 'Penisten, D K', 'Fulk, G W']","['Johnson BL', 'Edwards JS', 'Goss DA', 'Penisten DK', 'Fulk GW']","['School of Optometry, Indiana University, Bloomington 47405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Optom Assoc,Journal of the American Optometric Association,7505575,IM,,,,1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Am Optom Assoc. 1996 Oct;67(10):590-8.,,,19970102,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Astigmatism/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Lenses', 'Observer Variation', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Vision Tests/*methods', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper is an overview of the current literature on topics concerning VDTs and factors related to proposed etiologies for myopia. METHODS: Selected literature is reviewed on the relationship between VDTs and asthenopia, fatigue, accommodation, and vergence. Clinical studies of myopic progression and transient myopia among VDT users are considered, as is television viewing as a risk factor for juvenile myopia. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Reports of asthenopia are common with VDT use by a factor of 1.4 to 1.5, compared to conventional office work. Questions of comparability remain between VDT users and nonusers with respect to confounding variables such as the number of work hours. Proofreading on a VDT appears to be less efficient than using printed copy. Despite screen flicker and reflections, the accommodative response appears to be accurate to a VDT. Transient, fatigue-induced changes in accommodation and vergence may occur after work with VDTs. Despite these near point changes, there is no compelling evidence in the literature that suggests there is a significant increase in the risk of myopia onset or progression from the use of VDTs by adults compared to other forms of near work.","['Mutti, D O', 'Zadnik, K']","['Mutti DO', 'Zadnik K']","['School of Optometry, University of California, Berkeley 94270-2020, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Am Optom Assoc,Journal of the American Optometric Association,7505575,IM,,,,1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Am Optom Assoc. 1996 Sep;67(9):521-30.,,,19961203,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology', 'Child', '*Computer Terminals', 'Convergence, Ocular', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myopia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48,

If the compatibility concerning binocularity is solely estimated by the calculation of the difference of the retinal image sizes, using intraocular lens formulas or so-called ""aniseikonia-programs"", important physiological facts are not considered. The actual amount of the aniseikonia, this is the difference of the image size which the patient perceives subjectively, depends on 3 parameters: 1. the optically induced difference of the retinal image size, 2. the spatial density of the retinal photoreceptors and the size of the receptive fields, 3. a possibly existing anomalous retinal correspondence for different retinal image sizes. Besides aniseikonia, the induction of postoperative anisophoria by the required spectacle correction is a considerable aspect. Aniseikonia and anisophoria can cause fusional problems or diplopia because of the mentioned parameters and/or disparity of the retinal images. CASE REPORT: Cataract surgery should reduce a monolateral high myopia, aiming emmetropia, in axial anisometropia. This resulted in one exemplary case in high aniseikonia with complaints, while in other, comparable patients only a small amount of aniseikonia could be measured by haploscopy. This preoperative refractive situation is comparable to refractive surgery. In a second case with symmetrical myopia of -4 D, binocular problems with diplopia and asthenopia were induced after monolateral cataract surgery by the combination of a moderate aniseikonia and anisophoria. CONCLUSIONS: To predict the actual postoperative aniseikonia it is necessary for the patient to wear a contact lens preoperatively for a short time to measure the aniseikonia by haploscopy, particularly prior to refractive surgery in axial length ametropia. Due to the different sizes of the receptive fields of the retina, different postoperative aniseikonias may result in spite of similar axial length anisometropia. The individual tolerance of an adult for a postoperatively created anisophoria is hardly predictable. It is obvious that the fusional stress ensued from aniseikonia and anisophoria adds or multiplies. In contrast to horizontal eye movements, vertical eye movements can hardly be compensated by head movements, as the use of bi- or multifocals requires a down gaze of about 30 degrees. Here a height-balance-prism could help.","['Krzizok, T', 'Kaufmann, H', 'Schwerdtfeger, G']","['Krzizok T', 'Kaufmann H', 'Schwerdtfeger G']",['Universitats-Augenklinik fur Schielbehandlung und Neuroophthalmologie Giessen.'],['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,IM,,,,1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1035267 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1996 Jun;208(6):477-80. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1035267.,,,19961210,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anisometropia/diagnosis/*physiopathology', '*Cataract Extraction', 'Contact Lenses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lenses, Intraocular', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myopia/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Preoperative Care', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology']",,,,Binokulare Probleme durch Aniseikonie und Anisophorie nach Katarakt-Operation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each subject was asked to perform a word processing task using four different VDT workstation layouts. It was found that the main factor affecting OSA was not cathode ray tube (CRT) height itself but the distance between the CRT and keyboard. Thus the following workstation layout is recommended to realize comfortable VDT operation: (1) the desk height should be adjusted to the user's height; and (2) the CRT display should be set closer to the keyboard to provide a smaller OSA.,"['Sotoyama, M', 'Jonai, H', 'Saito, S', 'Villanueva, M B']","['Sotoyama M', 'Jonai H', 'Saito S', 'Villanueva MB']","['National Institute of Industrial Health, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,,,,1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00140139608964508 [doi]'],ppublish,Ergonomics. 1996 Jun;39(6):877-84. doi: 10.1080/00140139608964508.,,,19960816,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/prevention & control', '*Computer Terminals', 'Equipment Design', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blepharospasm, paucity of blinking, apraxia of lid opening, visual neglect, reduced vergence, reduced upgaze, and blurred vision are reported findings in these patients. The association of these findings with the disease, and their duration, severity, and treatment have not been systematically investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Parkinson's disease were prospectively examined. An age-matched control group was recruited from accompanying family members and volunteers. Data recorded included presence of visual complaint, the severity of the Parkinson's disease by Hoehn and Yahr Stage (scale = 1 to 5), duration of disease, pharmacologic therapy, visual acuity, ocular motility, accommodation, convergence amplitudes, and the near point of convergence. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were entered into each group, each with 21 men and 18 women. The average patient had had the disease for 8.9 years with a severity index of 2.6. Asthenopia, upgaze deficiency, and convergence insufficiency were significantly more common in the patients with Parkinson's disease than in the controls. Mean geometric visual acuity was poorer in the Parkinson's patients (20/39 compared with 20/28); P < .001). DISCUSSION: Visual complaints were significantly more common in the Parkinson's patients than in the age-matched controls. The frequency of ocular abnormalities was not related to the duration of the disease. Increasing severity seemed to be correlated with the presence of convergence insufficiency and a decline in acuity.","['Repka, M X', 'Claro, M C', 'Loupe, D N', 'Reich, S G']","['Repka MX', 'Claro MC', 'Loupe DN', 'Reich SG']","['Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus,Journal of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus,7901143,IM,,,,1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 1996 May-Jun;33(3):144-7.,,,19961104,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Convergence, Ocular', 'Eye Movements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/*complications/physiopathology', 'Parkinson Disease/*complications/physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vision Disorders/complications/physiopathology', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The workers had been engaged in wireless handling operation, with VDTs, of an unmanned power shovel (Worker 1), an unmanned 78-ton dump truck (Worker 2) and mobile monitor-cameras (Worker 3), for 10 months. Their working hours were about 6.5 hours per day; but, the Worker 2 could take a 10-minute recess (a period without VDT work) per about 30 minutes during working hours. Significant daily variations in the VEP latency, NPD and CFF were found in the Worker 1 or Worker 3 despite the absence of any significant daily or diurnal variations in the non-VDT workers; the trends in the variations were getting worse from Monday to Friday. The NPD in the VDT workers was significantly longer than that in each of the matched controls; also, the CFF in the Workers 1 and 3 was significantly depressed. The changes in the VEP latency from morning to noontime and in the NPD and CFF from noontime to evening were significantly larger in the VDT worker than in the matched control. These findings suggest that VDT work probably affects visual function assessed by the VEP, NPD and CFF.

The binocular vision evaluation comprised: detailed history and symptoms with an emphasis on the occurrence of near vision problems; modified binocular vision assessment which included cover test at near, ocular movements, convergence, Bagolini glasses, horizontal vergence reserves and prismatic measurement of any observed anomaly. History and symptoms revealed horizontal and vertical diplopia, jumbling of print, asthenopia, intermittent blurring and print being too small. Binocular vision assessment revealed exophoria at near, manifest horizontal deviations, convergence insufficiency, and vertical muscle imbalance. These anomalies occurred either singly or in combination. The results indicate that there is a need for binocular vision evaluation in low vision in order to reveal near vision disorders that may be partly attributable to binocular vision anomaly and not solely due to ocular pathology.

All three patients presented with similar symptoms of asthenopia when reading. Symptoms were alleviated for the first patient by use of orthoptic treatment of an exotropia with intermittent suppression. With the second patient, ocular motor functions were found to be within acceptable limits and relief of symptoms was obtained by the prescribing of lenses of a specific chromaticity.

A recent double-masked placebo-controlled trial showed that this condition cannot be solely explained as a placebo effect and that the beneficial filter is idiosyncratic and sometimes needs to be highly specific. Several mechanisms have been suggested for Meares-Irlen Syndrome including ocular motor (binocular and accommodative) anomalies, a sensitivity to patterned stimuli (pattern glare), and a deficit of the transient visual sub-system. We investigated these hypotheses by comparing 16 children, who reported the symptoms described above and who showed a sustained benefit from coloured filters, with 25 control children who came from the same school and were matched for age, reading performance and intelligence. The 'Meares-Irlen Syndrome' group had slightly, but significantly, reduced vergence and accommodative amplitudes and stereo-acuity; they also demonstrated significantly more pattern glare. The two groups did not differ significantly in their visual acuities, refractive error, dissociated or associated heterophoria, AC/A ratio, or ability to perceive 20 Hz flicker. It appears that certain ocular motor factors are correlates of Meares-Irlen Syndrome, rather than the primary underlying cause of the symptoms. The results support the hypothesis that pattern glare may be involved in the mechanism of Meares-Irlen Syndrome.","['Evans, B J', 'Busby, A', 'Jeanes, R', 'Wilkins, A J']","['Evans BJ', 'Busby A', 'Jeanes R', 'Wilkins AJ']","['Institute of Optometry, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0275-5408(95)00063-J [pii]', '10.1046/j.1475-1313.1995.9500063j.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 1995 Sep;15(5):481-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1475-1313.1995.9500063j.x.,,,19960122,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Convergence, Ocular/physiology', 'Dyslexia/physiopathology', 'Flicker Fusion/physiology', 'Humans', 'Perceptual Disorders/*physiopathology', 'Perceptual Distortion/*physiology', 'Psychometrics', 'Sensory Thresholds', 'Strabismus/physiopathology', 'Syndrome', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A demographic analysis.,479-83,,"BACKGROUND: The use of video display terminals (VDT) in the workplace is growing rapidly. Visual problems associated with computer use are increasing apace. Recognizing and addressing these needs are vital tasks for the optometric practitioner. This paper examines the demographics, prevalence of symptoms, and other work- and vision-related factors among VDT workers. Understanding the characteristics of a typical patient can aid in developing effective treatment protocols. METHODS: Twenty-two optometrists collected data from 324 patients who work on VDT screens for a minimum of 2 hours per day. A questionnaire was used to collect the data. Along with reporting the patients' dry manifest refraction results, the survey instrument also included a self-report of experienced symptoms. RESULTS: The prototypical patient, based on the total subject population, is a 38-year old, mildly myopic female who uses the computer screen about 5 hours per day. Average total VDT work experience is about 5 years. Most of the patients use full-color screens and sit between 21 and 22 inches away from the screen. A variety of visual symptoms is reported, with eyestrain (65 percent) and headaches (42 percent) being the most common complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Between 75 percent (results of this study) and 88 percent (reported by NIOSH) of patients who use a VDT regularly are likely to be symptomatic. This study has helped to identify the ""typical"" VDT user and the symptoms this user is most likely to report. The next step is to develop a diagnostic and treatment protocol by which optometrists can prescribe for and potentially prevent these computer-related vision problems.","['Salibello, C', 'Nilsen, E']","['Salibello C', 'Nilsen E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Optom Assoc,Journal of the American Optometric Association,7505575,IM,,,,1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Am Optom Assoc. 1995 Aug;66(8):479-83.,,,19960111,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alabama/epidemiology', 'Asthenopia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', '*Computer Terminals', '*Demography', 'Female', 'Georgia/epidemiology', 'Headache/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Washington/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Searching for a simple and reliable method for determination of an alternating central scotoma we used a pair of synoptophore fusion images, in the center of which we added the letter F respectively L as central control signs. A spontaneously perceived and persisting E means a perfect and stable orthophoria. A persisting F or L with fusion of the images means a one sided central scotoma. Alternation of F and L with fusion of the images means an alternating central scotoma. RESULTS: By examining normal readers, untreated asthenopic and untreated dyslexic patients, we found mostly rapid alternation of F and L in the latter two groups, whereas most of the normal readers saw F, L and E alternating at longer intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Thus undisturbed reading seems not to demand perfect orthophoria. On the other hand a rapidly alternating central scotoma may be considered as an important factor causing reading difficulties.","['Safra, D']",['Safra D'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,IM,,,,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1035463 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1995 May;206(5):365-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1035463.,,,19950817,,,"['Adolescent', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/etiology', 'Attention', 'Child', 'Color Perception', 'Dyslexia/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Orientation', 'Pattern Recognition, Visual', 'Reading', 'Scotoma/classification/complications/*diagnosis', '*Vision Tests']",,,,Der F-L-Test zur Feststellung eines alternierenden Zentralskotoms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of this study contradict the assumption existing in ophthalmology about an earlier onset of presbyopia in hypermetropia than in other types of refraction. Early correction of near vision is connected with superimposition of accommodation deterioration in ametropia. It is recommended to carry out rehabilitative measure as soon as the first asthenopia signs manifest; these measures should be aimed at weakening of refraction by the site of the furthest clear vision point.

In normal volunteers in whom either visual fatigue, general fatigue, or drunkeness was loaded intentionally, myopic shift of refraction, increased refractive fluctuation, and miosis were induced in all cases but the effect on amplitude of accommodative response was minimal. Subjects that worked at a computer terminal all day for 2 years, but not controls, developed myopic change at a statistically significant level. The effect on tonic level of accommodation of subject age, sustained near-vision tasks, and topical application of autonomic-related drugs was investigated. In subjects with severe eyestrain, myopic shift of tonic accommodation and prominent pupillary unrest were observed, suggesting increased parasympathetic excitation. One patient who was accidentally exposed to diisopropyl fluorophosphate, a potent cholinesterase inhibitor, showed a phenomenon similar to that mentioned above. Chaos attractors based upon the Shil'nikov phenomenon were introduced for evaluation of microfluctuation and pupillary unrest, as first applied by Sumida et al. Topical application of low-dose cyclopentolate hydrochloride was effective for treating accommodative abnormality in professional computed workers, who sometimes develop abnormal parasympathetic excitation. Based on quasi-static accommodation measurements, accommodative abnormality after head and neck injury, including whiplash injury, was divided into two completely different states: accommodative spasm and palsy. Since quasi-static accommodation was greatly affected by satellite ganglion block, sympathetic innervation from cervical ganglions may strongly influence accommodative response. Hyperthyroidism, which may be accompanied by sympathetic hyper-excitation, showed diminished accommodative response. In patients after refractive surgery by excimer laser, there was no difference in accommodative response before and after surgery, although tonic accommodation was slightly unstable after surgery. These findings suggest that the evaluation of tonic level or a similar state of accommodation and pupillary unrest will yield extremely valuable information in regard to various accommodative disturbances.","['Kinoshita, S']",['Kinoshita S'],"['Department of Ophthalmology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,,,,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 1994 Dec;98(12):1256-68.,,,19950217,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myopia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vision Disorders/drug therapy/*physiopathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In experiment 2 we compared the prevalence of pattern glare in matched groups of dyslexic children and good readers. The dyslexic group reported more pattern glare, but also reported more glare from a control stimulus. Pattern glare in the dyslexic group was directly correlated with flicker sensitivity. The results are related to recent research on visual processing and ocular-motor function in dyslexia.","['Evans, B J', 'Cook, A', 'Richards, I L', 'Drasdo, N']","['Evans BJ', 'Cook A', 'Richards IL', 'Drasdo N']","['Department of Vision Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Optom Vis Sci,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,8904931,IM,,,,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006324-199410000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Optom Vis Sci. 1994 Oct;71(10):619-28. doi: 10.1097/00006324-199410000-00004.,,,19950403,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/complications/therapy', 'Child', 'Contrast Sensitivity/physiology', 'Dyslexia/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lenses', 'Male', '*Reading', '*Sensory Aids', 'Vision Disorders/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They claim that some sensorial anomalies exist which can be diagnosed only by the Polatest and for which special terminology is used. The Polatest-Doctrine in microtropias, subnormal binocular vision and obligate fixation disparity leads to excessive amount of prisms and unnecessary eye muscle surgery. METHOD AND CONCLUSION: The reason for this is the erroneous interpretation of the Stereo-test with the two triangles, where it is not possible to distinguish between binocular vision or monocular suppression of the binocular visible dot. As some opticians prescribe prisms on their own, sometimes for patients who are treated by ophthalmologists, this method leads to arguments between ophthalmologists and those opticians.","['Lang, J']",['Lang J'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,IM,,,,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1035562 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1994 May;204(5):378-80. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1035562.,,,19940908,,,"['Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Eyeglasses', 'Fixation, Ocular/physiology', 'Humans', 'Oculomotor Muscles/surgery', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Strabismus/etiology/*therapy', 'Vision Disparity/physiology', 'Vision Tests/*instrumentation', 'Vision, Binocular/*physiology']",,,,Die sensorischen und standespolitischen Schwachstellen der Prismenverordnung am Polatest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-seven office workers and their work stations were investigated by means of questionnaires and worksite investigations. The data were subjected to multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The occurrence of eye discomfort increased as the extent of VDT work increased, as did the specific symptoms of sensitivity to light and smarting, gritting feeling, or redness. The use of spectacles during visual display terminal work, age, stomach stress reaction, distances between the eye and different visual task objects, as well as the vertical position of the terminal also influenced certain symptoms. Having (i) the terminal at about eye level during prolonged terminal work, (ii) using monofocal glasses during terminal work in situations with large distance variations to visual task objects, or (iii) being elderly with prolonged terminal work and reporting stomach stress all led to increased odds ratios for certain eye discomfort symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a visual display terminal in routine office work is associated with an increased occurrence of certain eye discomfort symptoms. This association is affected also by the presence of certain other individual and ergonomic factors.","['Bergqvist, U O', 'Knave, B G']","['Bergqvist UO', 'Knave BG']","['Department of Neuromedicine, National Institute of Occupational Health, Solna, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,IM,,,,1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1432 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.1432 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1994 Feb;20(1):27-33. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.1432.,,,19940727,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology', 'Cohort Studies', '*Computer Terminals', 'Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Work Schedule Tolerance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Perimetry was undertaken for both eyes of 20 normal persons and 20 persons with ocular hypertension using Program G1X (Interzeag AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) of the Octopus 1-2-3 perimeter. Global mean defect and loss variance were calculated for each of the eight individual stages and global SF was calculated for stages 5 to 8. The superoinferior and nasotemporal hemifield indices and those for within and beyond 17 degrees eccentricity were calculated separately to investigate the locus of the fatigue effect. RESULTS: Group mean mean defect and loss variance deteriorated over stages (P < 0.001) and between eyes for both groups (P < 0.001; P < 0.004). The deterioration in the mean defect was more marked peripherally (P < 0.001) and inferiorly with age and group (P < 0.001) whereas the localized loss was more pronounced peripherally (P < 0.001), superiorly (P < 0.010) and nasally (P < 0.001). A 1-minute break during the examination of a given eye and a 3-minute break between eyes was insufficient to overcome the fatigue effect. The performance of the two groups was almost indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: The deterioration in the visual field indices mean defect and loss variance challenges the currently accepted ideal length of a perimetric examination with the conventional algorithms. Confidence limits for the definition of abnormality with these algorithms should reflect the presence of the fatigue effect and be different for the second eye.","['Hudson, C', 'Wild, J M', ""O'Neill, E C""]","['Hudson C', 'Wild JM', ""O'Neill EC""]","['Department of Vision Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,IM,,,,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1994 Jan;35(1):268-80.,,,19940307,,,"['Aged', 'Asthenopia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Ocular Hypertension/physiopathology', 'Sensory Thresholds/*physiology', 'Visual Field Tests/*adverse effects', 'Visual Fields/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, near-reflex measurement ascertained decreases in amplitude and the velocity of accommodation function after the visual task. Second, light-reflex measurement revealed a delay of the reflex, an increase in the amplitude of the reflex, and a decrease in pupil size after the visual task. A weak correlation between the decrease in pupil size and accommodation function was found.

The prevalence of asthenopia in such workers is rather high, between 40 and 80%. The considerable specificity of the symptoms and the shortcomings in assessment of exposure in most of the research done so far has meant that no clear and unequivocal causal relationship between work involving intense visual effort and onset of asthenopia has been established. Nevertheless, from an analysis of the literature three main guidelines for a correct ergophthalmologic assessment can be identified: a) ophthalmologic assessments that will detect any transitory inefficiencies of the accommodation and convergence system; b) specific analysis of the technical and illumination conditions with special attention to the distribution of the natural and artificial light sources; c) quantification of airborne pollutants that have a potential irritative effect on the ""ocular surface"".

The results were as follows: 1) Of these workers, 81.9% engaged in VDT operation. For most of the subjective symptoms, the prevalence rates tended to increase with the degree of VDT use. 2) These complaints were combined to give visual and musculoskeletal symptom scores. Both of the scores were higher among females than males, and the musculoskeletal symptom score was significantly higher. No difference was found in regard to age. 3) Analysis using log-linear models was performed to evaluate the effects of sex and age. The results showed that the visual and musculoskeletal symptom scores were significantly higher among the workers operating VDTs for one or more hours per day than among those who did not operate them at all. Analysis of the effects of VDT workloads revealed that VDT use for five or more days per week significantly increased the prevalence rates of both symptoms. Their use for less than four days per week affected neither of the symptoms. With regard to operating time per day or length of VDT use, no differences were found. 4) This investigation suggested that the VDT workloads were not so heavy and that the effects on each symptom were minor among the subjects of the present survey. However, it is important that consideration be given to ensure that the workloads for workers who operate VDTs every day not be too heavy.","['Shima, M', 'Nitta, Y', 'Iwasaki, A', 'Adachi, M']","['Shima M', 'Nitta Y', 'Iwasaki A', 'Adachi M']","['Department of Public Health, Chiba University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Eiseigaku Zasshi,Nihon eiseigaku zasshi.

In linear proportion to the total working hours, occipital midline beta-2 amplitude, subjective rating of tiredness and subjective symptoms of fatigue rose, but critical flicker values fell slightly in the task with maximum effort. It was inferred from these results that with lapse of working hours intellectual activity and feeling of fatigue increase and the level of arousal slightly declines.

These changes remain in effect as long as motor fusion is maintained. Elimination of fusion by occlusion or by removal of the prism results in a slow movement of the eyes back to the preprism position. This phenomenon, known as prism adaptation or slow fusional vergence, has important clinical implications in maintaining binocular vision with anisometropic prescriptions, age-related physiological changes in the positions of the eyes, blinking, high phorias, etc. Vergence adaptation is useful in explaining previous discrepancies between alternate and unilateral cover test, pre- and postorthoptic ACA ratios, stimulus and response ACA ratios, changes in phorias after orthoptics, and the observation of patients ""eating up prism."" Vergence adaptation anomalies have been implicated in causing asthenopia. Adaptation has been shown to change after orthoptic therapy.

The eye examinations revealed that on the average, the VDU workers suffered more than twice as many visual impairments as the controls. In those with correct vision, the near point of accommodation was measured at the beginning of the workday at the start of the week, and at the end of the workday, four days later. In the VDU group, the decrease in accommodation was uniformally distributed between zero and 1.0 diopter, whereas among the non-VDU workers, 77% of the decrease was between zero and 0.25 diopter. The dynamic range of accommodation in the VDU workers on the second examination was smaller than on the first.

TMD is associated with numerous risk factors that commonly initiate sympathetic nervous system and stress hormone response mechanisms resulting in muscle spasms, trigger point formation, and pain in the head and neck. Likewise VDT operation may be linked to three additional sympathetic nervous system irritants including: (1) electrostatic ambient air negative ion depletion, (2) electromagnetic radiation, and (3) eyestrain and postural stress associated with poor work habits and improper work station design.

The modulation is greater at certain wavelengths than at others, and it can therefore be reduced by wearing tinted spectacles.

In the experimental study, the visual loads of a one-hour word processing task and a video game were compared with various indices, such as critical flicker fusion, near point distance, blinking counts, eyeball movement, pupillary reflex and subjective fatigue symptoms in ten healthy male college students. The results of this study were as follows: 1) The viewing distance between the eyes and the TV screen was shorter for video games than for watching TV programs. 2) The rate of complaints related to eye strain in children who played video games over 120 min per day was significantly higher than that of other children. 3) The eye movements during video games were more rapid and frequent than those during conventional VDT work. 4) A decrease in CFF value and an extension of near point distance and an increase in subjective fatigue symptoms were demonstrated for both the word processing task and the video game. No significant differences were observed between the above two experimental conditions. This suggests that the visual loads for video games are similar to those for VDT work. These findings suggest that regulating the playing times to 60 minutes or less per day is necessary to prevent negative health effects in children.","['Misawa, T', 'Shigeta, S', 'Nojima, S']","['Misawa T', 'Shigeta S', 'Nojima S']","['Department of Environmental Medicine and Occupational Health, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Eiseigaku Zasshi,Nihon eiseigaku zasshi.

Each keypuncher had been engaged in data entry for 1-7 (mean, 4) years. After VDT work, the number of complaints of subjective fatigue as well as an objective measure of near-point distance were significantly increased as compared with those before work; also, the N75, P100 and N145 latencies of VEP were significantly prolonged. The change of P100 latency during VDT work was inversely correlated with the number of years worked in data entry. No significant change was seen in any of these tests in the non-VDT-exposed subjects. The changes in N75 latency and subjective fatigue related to drowsiness and dullness in the keypunchers were significantly larger than those in the non-VDT-exposed subjects. The CFF was significantly lower in keypunchers than in non-VDT-exposed subjects in both the first and the second tests. These data suggest that VDT work is associated with impairment of the visual nervous system function, that VEP latencies appear to be a sensitive indicator of visual fatigue, at least transiently, and that CFF appears to be a good parameter for estimations of chronic visual fatigue.","['Murata, K', 'Araki, S', 'Kawakami, N', 'Saito, Y', 'Hino, E']","['Murata K', 'Araki S', 'Kawakami N', 'Saito Y', 'Hino E']","['Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,IM,,,,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00379073 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 1991;63(2):109-13. doi: 10.1007/BF00379073.,,,19911015,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/*physiopathology', 'Cerebral Cortex/*physiopathology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Distance Perception/physiology', 'Evoked Potentials, Visual/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flicker Fusion/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Occupational Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensory Thresholds/physiology', 'Visual Pathways/physiopathology', 'Work Schedule Tolerance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Experiment 1, dark vergence and reports of visual fatigue symptoms associated with computer use were measured in 104 persons. Dark vergence was significantly correlated with four of six symptoms of visual fatigue. In Experiment 2, 16 subjects who exhibited clear ""Heuer effects"" (systematic gaze-related changes in dark vergence) read from a video display terminal (VDT) at a distance of 20 cm for 60 min under two gaze elevation conditions: 20 deg above and 20 deg below a baseline gaze elevation. This manipulation was designed to vary the amount of vergence effort required to fixate the VDT. Results indicate a positive relation between vergence effort and visual fatigue both within and between subjects, and that prolonged near work leads to decreased vergence accuracy at far distances. Implications for VDT workstation design are discussed.","['Tyrrell, R A', 'Leibowitz, H W']","['Tyrrell RA', 'Leibowitz HW']","['Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Factors,Human factors,0374660,IM S,,,,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/001872089003200307 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Factors. 1990 Jun;32(3):341-57. doi: 10.1177/001872089003200307.,,,19910131,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/*etiology', 'Child', '*Computer Terminals', 'Darkness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', '*Work']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a sustained accommodative stimulus on the tonic level of accommodation, pupil, and convergence, i.e., the near triad, in three different groups of young (20-39 years) subjects, viz., 1. 19 professional visual display unit (VDU) workers; 2. 12 ordinary hard copy (non-VDU) workers; and 3. 19 control subjects doing different jobs from the two former groups. All had worked 25-30 h per week for over two years. Only Groups 1 and 2 had eyestrain after office work. Except for mild myopia, subjects had no eye or systemic disease upon routine examination. Accommodation was measured with an objective infrared optometer, the pupil was measured by an infrared video pupillography, and convergence was measured from the contralateral eye by photoelectronic oculography. In order to elicit tonic responses, the velocity of the target stimulus was 0.2 D (diopters) per second. Based on the data obtained from the controls, the near triad was analysed. Asymmetric response of the near triad in the right and the left eye and the existence of a hysteresis curve, especially in the pupil and in convergence, were the major findings. No abnormality was found in the control group. In the VDU group, 34.6% showed an abnormal near triad, but this also occurred in 18.5% of the non-VDU group. Even with the same complaint of eyestrain, it was concluded that VDU work produced abnormalities 1.8 times higher in the near triad produced by tonic stimulus.","['Ishikawa, S']",['Ishikawa S'],"['Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, Kitasato University, Sagamihara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ergonomics,Ergonomics,0373220,IM S,,,,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00140139008927185 [doi]'],ppublish,Ergonomics. 1990 Jun;33(6):787-98. doi: 10.1080/00140139008927185.,,,19901206,,,"['Accommodation, Ocular/physiology', 'Adult', 'Asthenopia/etiology/*physiopathology', '*Computer Terminals', 'Convergence, Ocular/physiology', 'Humans', 'Myopia/etiology/physiopathology', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Pupil/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reading speed was found to be directly proportional to the visual acuity of the eye tested. However, the same visual acuity in both eyes does not always mean that the subject reads at the same speed with both eyes. For example, paracentral visual field defects impair reading ability and eyes which appear to have good vision may easily become tired. Twelve of 16 examined eyes with maculopathy showed a significant decrease in reading speed during a reading test lasting no more than 2 minutes. In tests of the same duration cataract patients did not tire; their reading speed increased. Binocular vision helps improve reading speed in cases of maculopathy, and even more so in cases of glaucoma with visual field defects. Attention is drawn to Mackensen's suggestion that measurement of reading speed is a valuable function test, and to the fact that in certain cases fatigue of an eye during reading is a new and measurable criterion of the degree of visual impairment.","['Stangler-Zuschrott, E']",['Stangler-Zuschrott E'],"['I.

By examining the difference in the visual function involved in watching 2D and stereoscopic 3D displays, we could extract only the effect on visual perception in stereoscopic 3D television. Since the visual fatigue with the 3D display may be caused by the discrepancy between convergence and accommodation, the near point distances were measured by an Accommodo Polyrecorder, where Landolt's ring was pursued with binocularity. Five subjects, all employees of NEC Corporation, participated in the experiment. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Two of the subjects watched a 3D video movie. After a week, they watched another video movie in 2D. The rest of them watched the movies in reverse order. One video movie viewing requires about 120 minutes. The near point distances were measured before and after watching for 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The 3D television system used here is a 3D video disc system with field sequence using glasses with liquid crystal shutters. In the case of 2D, each subject wore the glasses whose shutters were kept open. In the experiment, instruction to watch the video movies in a relaxed posture was given. There was a significant effect in regard to 3D/2D treatments on the change rates of the near point distance measured after watching every 30 minutes to one before watching.

Subjective VDT-related symptoms of asthenopia were assessed by means of a questionnaire. All operators were examined by an ophthalmologist. Visual acuity was measured using vision tables with optotypes. In order to achieve an objective assessment of VDT-induced visual fatigue, refractive power was measured at the beginning and at the end of the shift, using an infra-red autorefractometer. Changes in refractive power were then related to VDT work and asthenopia symptoms. Visual acuity defects were observed in 63.5% of the operators; in 36% of the cases the subjects were either unaware of the defects or the defects were not adequately corrected. 62.5% of the operators complained of subjective asthenopia symptoms. Asthenopia was not related to the number of hours at the VDT. The results suggest that ametropic subjects are likely to be more susceptible to visual fatigue than emmetropic subjects, since there was a tendency for the prevalence of asthenopia to increase in the former group. A significant decrease in refractive power (temporary myopization) was observed in 20% of the operators at the end of the shift at the VDT: all these subjects also complained of asthenopia, compared to 50% of the workers without end-of-shift myopization. The difference between the groups was highly significant (p less than 0.01); contrarywise, none of the subjects without asthenopia developed myopization. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that end-of-shift myopization, as measured by an automatic refractometer, may be used as a reliable objective measurement of VDT-related visual fatigue.","['Luberto, F', 'Gobba, F', 'Broglia, A']","['Luberto F', 'Gobba F', 'Broglia A']",,['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,IM,,,,1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 1989 Mar-Apr;80(2):155-63.,,,19890925,,,"['Adult', 'Asthenopia/*etiology', '*Computer Systems', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myopia/*etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Refractive Errors/etiology', 'Time Factors']",,,,Miopizzazione temporanea e sintomatologia soggettiva in operatori al videoterminale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In agreement with the first hypothesis, subjects with large initial vergence discrepancy increased their observation distance more in the course of 1 1/2 hours of visual work than subjects with smaller initial vergence discrepancy. Visual fatigue was assessed using a set of questions developed in two pilot studies. Contrary to the second hypothesis, visual fatigue did not depend on effective vergence discrepancy, that is, the deviation between the resting level of the vergence system and the actual angle of convergence.

The ages of the operators ranged between 47 and 58 years. The operators' head movements, in looking from the keyboard to the screen, were two to three times greater when bifocal spectacles were worn compared with specially prescribed single-vision occupational spectacles. There were also greater movements in the flexion of the wrist and elbow while using bifocal spectacles and looking from the keyboard to the screen. There was no relationship between the amount of head movement and the position of the bifocal reading segment with respect to the operators' pupil.

VDT-induced symptoms were assessed by means of subject answers to a questionnaire. To measure VDT-induced ocular fatigue objectively, refraction power was determined before and at the end of workshift by an infrared autorefractometer. Job-induced refraction changes were then related to visual complaints and conditions in the workplace. The results confirmed that VDT data-acquisition work can lead to temporary myopia (myopization) in a remarkable percentage of operators; a significant correlation between eye discomfort, ocular asthenopia, and myopization was also found. Illumination levels, luminance, and contrast seem to be of paramount importance regarding visual symptoms: neither asthenopia nor myopization was observed when all of these conditions were adequate. If the ergonomic design of the workplace and the viewing distance are adequate, there are also usually fewer musculoskeletal symptoms. Our results suggest that changes in the ocular refraction status before and at the end of the work-shift, as determined by an automatic refractometer, provide a good objective index of VDT-induced ""ocular fatigue"", which in our study proved to be significantly related to workplace conditions.","['Gobba, F M', 'Broglia, A', 'Sarti, R', 'Luberto, F', 'Cavalleri, A']","['Gobba FM', 'Broglia A', 'Sarti R', 'Luberto F', 'Cavalleri A']","['Cattedra di Medicina del Lavoro, University of Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,IM,,,,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00381485 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 1988;60(2):81-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00381485.,,,19880414,,,"['Asthenopia/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Computer Systems', 'Ergonomics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interior Design and Furnishings', 'Lighting/adverse effects', 'Myopia/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the advent of colour coding in electro-optical displays, the need for a detailed quantification of focusing responses to chromatic stimuli is particularly important because of the influence of the chromatic aberration present in ocular optics on the focusing response of the eye. In this regard, we used a computer-aided laser speckle optometer system to measure the accommodative responses of 20 visually normal subjects, to brightness-matched monochromatic and multichromatic stimuli displayed on a high-resolution RGB monitor. We also investigated the effect of target size, target clarity, and viewing distance on the response accuracy of the focusing system of the eye. Our results show that while the accommodative responses are systematically influenced by target chromaticity, they are relatively independent of target size. There was no evidence of any anomalous focusing responses resulting from either target chromaticity or defocus that could account for the asthenopia frequently reported by VDU users. Furthermore, moderate levels of optical defocus did not drive accommodation into any visible hunting pattern for optimal focus or towards its tonic resting position. Implications of these findings in display designs are presented.","['Lovasik, J V', 'Kergoat, H']","['Lovasik JV', 'Kergoat H']","['University of Waterloo, School of Optometry, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),8208839,IM,,,,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0275-5408(88)90016-6 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1475-1313.1988.tb01184.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 1988;8(4):450-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.1988.tb01184.x.,,,19890814,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adult', 'Color Perception/*physiology', '*Computer Systems', 'Humans', 'Pattern Recognition, Visual/physiology', 'Refraction, Ocular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 39-year-old male, first seen on February 2, 1981, had an occipitalgia, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. For several months before this consultation, the patient had suffered from asthenopia. Brain CT scan and cerebral angiogram demonstrated internal hydrocephalus due to aqueduct stenosis of unknown etiology. After a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation on February 20, 1981, he completely recovered. Two years and a half after the shunt insertion he had no difficulty in his daily life. He reentered the hospital on December 21, 1983, because of personality change, mental deterioration and bradykinesia. Brain CT scan showed recurrent hydrocephalus resulting from shunt blockage. Following the shunt revision, hydrocephalus was resolved. Nevertheless, the patient did not return to his previous state. And he became bed-ridden, incontinent of urine, and unable to take fluids or foods, following which he went into a state of akinetic mutism. Other neurological findings were as follows: upward gaze palsy, impaired convergence, convergence nystagmus, plastic rigidity of neck and all four limbs, and diffuse hyperreflexia with right Babinski's sign. Abnormal involuntary movement was not seen. On March 27, 1984, levodopa therapy was instituted and on April 2, trihexyphenidyl was combined with levodopa. Shortly after administration of levodopa and trihexyphenidyl, akinetic mutism began to improve, but upward gaze palsy was not affected. He began to speak and could walk unassisted by the end of July.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Watahiki, Y', 'Narita, S', 'Kurahashi, K', 'Tanaka, T', 'Matsunaga, M']","['Watahiki Y', 'Narita S', 'Kurahashi K', 'Tanaka T', 'Matsunaga M']","['Department of Clinical Neurology, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,No To Shinkei,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,0413550,IM,,,,1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,No To Shinkei. 1987 Oct;39(10):977-82.,,,19880325,"['3A64E3G5ZO (Bromocriptine)', '46627O600J (Levodopa)', '6RC5V8B7PO (Trihexyphenidyl)']",,"['Adult', 'Akinetic Mutism/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Bromocriptine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Hydrocephalus/*complications', 'Levodopa/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Trihexyphenidyl/*administration & dosage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These eye movements were elicited by watching each target, a far fixation target and a near fixation target, which alternated from far to near every five seconds on the accommodopolyrecorder. Measurements by this method were conducted at two points in time: before beginning the VDT work and after completing the work. The convergence time was unchanged before and after the work load. The divergence time, however, was prolonged after the work load, which was highly significant (P less than 0.001).

Reading produced significant increases in both tonic levels, with the magnitude of change being similar in the two groups. After reading, both groups exhibited rapid loss of the tonic vergence effect, but showed no evidence for decay of the tonic accommodation effect. Differences between the groups were observed in the rate of adaptation during the course of reading, with both tonic components increasing more slowly for the symptomatic subjects than for the asymptomatic subjects. In addition, baseline tonic accommodation was significantly higher in the symptomatic group than in the asymptomatic group. The results suggest that although the failure to undergo tonic oculomotor adaptation is not a causal factor in asthenopia, the initial steady-state level and/or subsequent temporal changes of tonic accommodation and tonic vergence may be related to nearwork symptomatology.","['Fisher, S K', 'Ciuffreda, K J', 'Levine, S', 'Wolf-Kelly, K S']","['Fisher SK', 'Ciuffreda KJ', 'Levine S', 'Wolf-Kelly KS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Optom Physiol Opt,American journal of optometry and physiological optics,0417614,IM,,,,1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006324-198705000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Optom Physiol Opt. 1987 May;64(5):333-43. doi: 10.1097/00006324-198705000-00007.,,,19870826,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adult', '*Convergence, Ocular', '*Eye Movements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reading', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there was a higher prevalence of visual strain and musculo-skeletal complaints among the older workers. A follow up study on the performance of 22 operators for 5 years showed that there was a significant reverse correlation between age and keying speed, r = 0.74 (p less than 0.01). A lower but significant correlation was also noted for typing errors and age, r = 0.50, (p less than 0.05).

Effects of difference in input devices].,462-9,,"Effects of the difference in input device on work load of VDT task were studied. The subjects of the experiment were eight healthy male college students (age: 21-22 yr) having a binocular vision of not less than 0.7 and no astigmatism or hyperopia. The test consisted of an experimental word processing task in which the subjects visually searched e's in given sequences of alphabetical letters displayed on the CRT and converted them to 5's through input device operation. As for experimental conditions, two kinds of input devices, namely, keyboard and lightpen were adopted and 1 h was provided as each operation time. Critical flicker fusion (CFF), near point distance, accommodation time, subjective fatigue symptoms, blinking counts, pupillary reflex, electromyogram in upper limb, neck and shoulder and performance score were measured. The results were as follows. Decrease in C.F.F. was observed in two experimental conditions during the process of operating time. Increments in complaints of subjective fatigue related to visual function were seen in the two experimental conditions after 1 h VDT task. A higher error rate in performance was observed in the subjects using the lightpen compared to the one using the keyboard. The frequency of both blinking and pupil-size changes were lower in the subjects using the lightpen compared to those using the keyboard. This suggests that the gaze time of the VDT screen with lightpen-condition is longer than that in keyboard-condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Misawa, T', 'Shigeta, S']","['Misawa T', 'Shigeta S']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Sangyo Igaku,Sangyo igaku.

Biological information (for example: sex, age), life histories, information about VDT work, tests (for example: visual acuity), symptoms and interferences to daily life of VDT workers and control subjects were collected. The following results were obtained. Female VDT workers experienced more fatigue from commuting to work, stiffness in shoulders, distant blurred vision complaints of visual acuity and sum of the scores of ocular complaints than female control subjects. Only among female VDT workers, the longer the daily working hours, the greater were their ocular symptoms. A remarkable relationships were observed between psychological burden factors (for example: self-control of VDT work, sensation of excessive VDT work) and subjective symptoms of the VDT workers (both sexes). In particular, VDT workers who considered VDT work to be excessive had marked by greater subjective symptoms than those who did not.","['Sugita, M', 'Minowa, H', 'Ishii, M', 'Etoh, R']","['Sugita M', 'Minowa H', 'Ishii M', 'Etoh R']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Sangyo Igaku,Sangyo igaku.

Eye strain induced by VDT work was able to take an objective view as accommodative and convergent depression including the tear productive function, followed by making good working conditions. 2. The measurement of eye movement was able to analyze the response time and the response process for the informations indicating on the display, and the concept of recovery time for deteriorated accommodative function was useful to improve the display design. 3. It was suggested that the measurement of visual evoked potential was more simple method to evaluate the workers' attention. 4.

A physiological model is presented, suggesting that this effector system mismatch arises from the activation of autonomic reflexes related to stress, vigilant attention and information-processing. Autonomic arousal exerts a cycloplegic-like effect. Excess accommodative effort, which must be exerted to achieve required accommodation, produces a tendency towards overconvergence. The demand for integration of accommodation and convergence, essential for efficient nearpoint function, is thus incompatible with our own physiology, since autonomic arousal is inherent in task demands for attention and mental effort associated with reading. Additionally, autonomic arousal is generated by the high levels of stress pervasive in our society. Various refractive, binocular and accommodative deviations may arise adaptively in order to resolve this mismatch and facilitate efficient nearpoint visual function. These nearpoint stress-induced visual disorders parallel stress-induced systemic illness in that both result from the activation of physiological processes which are inappropriate for the demands and stresses of our society.","['Birnbaum, M H']",['Birnbaum MH'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Optom Assoc,Journal of the American Optometric Association,7505575,IM,,,,1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Am Optom Assoc. 1984 Nov;55(11):825-35.,,,19850131,,,"['*Accommodation, Ocular', 'Arousal', 'Asthenopia/*etiology', 'Attention', 'Convergence, Ocular', 'Humans', 'Physical Exertion', '*Reading', 'Stress, Physiological/*complications', 'Stress, Psychological/complications', 'Vision Disorders/etiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critical flicker fusion, near point distance, subjective fatigue symptoms, heart rate, respiratory rate, blinking counts, electromyogram in upper limb and performance score were measured. Results are as follows. Decrease in critical flicker fusion, increase in near point distance and subjective fatigue symptoms appeared in all three sets of experimental conditions after two hour tasks. Increased slow wave components on electromyogram and increased errors in performance appeared after 60-minute or more tasks without intermission. Effects on the critical flicker fusion, near point distance, subjective fatigue symptoms, electromyogram, blinking counts and errors in performance were least in the third set.

We measured the effects of CFF (critical fusion frequency), TAF (the ability to maintain concentration), EEG (electroencephalogram) and near-point accommodation of various changes in the duration of the testing period. The subjects were seven male university students who performed single multiplication problems at a rate of 60 per minute.

The results obtained were as follows; CFF values and near-point accommodation of VDT performance were significantly decreased compared to Non-VDT's as a control. The TAF test showed that the mental strain in a VDT task is greater than that in a Non-VDT task. CFF values of VDT performance showed a tendency to decline in the 30th min after commencement, but in the 60th min and thereafter a significant lowering was noticed. In TAF and near-point accommodation of VDT performance, the greatest decline was in the 60th min, and this was significantly reduced only immediately after the work period. CFF values and near-point accommodation were not recovered after 60 min from the end of a 90 min VDT task. However, TAF X L values recovered in the 30th min after VDT performance.

Positive malingering is the former, and negative malingering is the latter. Hysteria is similar to malingering except that it is unconscious. Ocular malingering is common among draft evaders. The flight surgeon or military ophthalmologist will more commonly see the negative malingerer in peacetime because of the high physical standards for flying. Wartime creates a sudden shift towards positive malingering, however, for obvious reasons. This paper carefully defines the distinctions between malingering, hysteria, and true disease consistent with the defect claimed. It also provides a systematic approach to history, examination, and special testing of a possible ocular malingerer/hysteric. A number of common ocular complaints are considered separately, including decreased visual acuity, visual field defects, night vision defects, color vision defects, ocular muscle defects, automutilatory defects, opacification of transparent media, blepharospasm, intraocular disease, and asthenopia.","['Hesterberg, R C Jr', 'Tredici, T J']","['Hesterberg RC Jr', 'Tredici TJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Aviat Space Environ Med,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",7501714,IM S,,,,1983/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Aviat Space Environ Med. 1983 Oct;54(10):934-6.,,,19840107,,,"['*Aerospace Medicine', 'Humans', '*Hysteria', '*Malingering', 'Vision Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Vision, Ocular/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA: 84079564'],,,,

Twenty-four patients with horizontal squint (average age 63 years) wanted the operation because of diplopia, asthenopia and, in a few cases, for cosmetic reasons; 5 patients were aphakic. The operation was successful in 20 cases. The principles of dosing the operation are essentially the same as for juvenile patients. However, specific difficulties in treating elderly patients arise from: (1) lack of accommodative convergence, as a result of which the squint angle difference between distance and near fixation is usually greater; (2) increasing rigidity of the eye muscles, which diminishes the range of fusion; as a result, the patient is unable spontaneously to compensate for minor squint deviations; (3) senile organic lesions of the bulbs further impair fusion. It is advisable to treat convergent squint by correcting the average deviation between distance and near fixation, preferably shortening the external recti. Cases of divergent squint should preferably be treated by correcting the smaller squint angle, with resection of the external recti. The older the patient is and the worse his fusion, the more precisely the operation has to be dosed. Orthoptic training helps in old patients too.","['Stangler-Zuschrott, E']",['Stangler-Zuschrott E'],,['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,IM,,,,1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1055256 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1982 Nov;181(5):397-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1055256.,,,19830407,,,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Presbyopia/*surgery', 'Strabismus/*surgery']",,,,Schieloperationen an presbyopen Patienten.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dealing with glaucoma controlled studies are emphasized which attempt to determine the structure of neuroses and the importance of environmental situations. Using the MMPI high values on the scales 'depression', 'hypochondria' and 'hysteria' were observed. In previous attempts to influence glaucoma psychotherapeutically mainly autosuggestive and hypnotizing methods have been applied. The number of reported cases of psychogenic blindness has decreased considerably. We discuss, that it may not only be caused by the mechanism of hysterical conversion but also by a tendency to regression in schizoid neurotic structure. Concerning asthenopia and amblyopia the dependence of vision and visual acuity of the level of vegetative innervation is being accentuated; there appear to be correlations between certain errors of refraction and certain personality patterns. Psychiatric diseases may also influence vision: observations in paranoid and affective psychoses of later life and in schizophrenic children confirm it. This leads to the question, if schizoid neurotic structure can also be characterized by a specific disturbance in affective relations to sensations. Examples are given for investigations on other diseases (ablantio retinae, retinopathia centrales serosa), on the problem of self mutilation (auto-enuclation) and on neurophysiological question (psychogenic influences on pupil size).","['Niklewski, G']",['Niklewski G'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Psychosom Med Psychoanal,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychoanalyse,0107166,IM,,,,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Z Psychosom Med Psychoanal. 1982;28(3):300-16.,,,19821202,,,"['Amblyopia/psychology', 'Blindness/psychology', 'Eye Diseases/*psychology', 'Freudian Theory', 'Glaucoma/psychology', 'Humans', 'MMPI', 'Neurotic Disorders/psychology', 'Psychoanalytic Therapy/methods', 'Psychophysiologic Disorders/*psychology', 'Sick Role', 'Vision Disorders/*psychology', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,Psychosomatische Erkrankungen des Auges.

The results show that decentration is required on account of each of these factors. Considerable correction is needed in the vertical direction, a fact much neglected nowadays; and vertical decentration results in vertical phoria which is more symptomatic than horizontal phorias.

An objective correlate of this symptom has so far never been demonstrated. Averaged visual evoked potential (VEP) in 10 patients with asthenopia was compared with 20 normal subjects.

There was no difference of latency of the VEPs in the two groups, but the amplitude of the most prominent component was significantly reduced in the patients. There was also a difference in the two groups regarding habituation and lateralisation. No amplitude difference could be found in the somatosensory evoked potential. The amplitude difference in VEP, as an objective correlate of asthenopia, is probably modal specific and suggests involvement of the visual cortex. VEP is unsuitable as a diagnostic tool due to the great overlap between amplitudes in asthenopic patients and control subjects.","['Gulmann, N C', 'Hammerberg, P E', 'Jensen, L B', 'Sommerbeck, K W', 'Orbaek, K']","['Gulmann NC', 'Hammerberg PE', 'Jensen LB', 'Sommerbeck KW', 'Orbaek K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Acta Neurol Scand,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,0370336,IM,,,,1979/06/01 00:00,1979/06/01 00:01,['1979/06/01 00:00'],"['1979/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0404.1979.tb02943.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neurol Scand. 1979 Jun;59(6):324-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1979.tb02943.x.,,,19791128,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthenopia/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Eye Movements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Median Nerve/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Visual Pathways/physiopathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
