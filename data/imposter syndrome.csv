Imposter syndrome has been linked to burnout in residents, and understanding how to combat it may help improve resiliency in residents. Methods: We held a facilitator-guided, interactive discussion session for internal medicine residents on the topic of imposter syndrome as part of a larger series of discussion sessions on resident wellness. We repeated the session to capture a different group of residents. A psychologist or chief resident led each 30- to 45-minute session with the option to include an attending physician. Residents, faculty, and a clinical psychologist developed instructions for leading this session. At the end of each session, the facilitator provided attendees with a handout with take-home points and an optional postsurvey to assess learning objectives and ask whether they felt this was an effective intervention to promote resident wellness. Results: We collected data from 21 residents who attended the small-group discussion sessions. Ninety-six percent of residents felt comfortable recognizing imposter syndrome in themselves, and 62% knew the appropriate next steps after identifying imposter syndrome. Eighty-one percent of residents felt that the imposter syndrome wellness session was an effective intervention to promote resident wellness. Discussion: Imposter syndrome has been linked to resident burnout, and discussing imposter syndrome was viewed as an effective intervention to promote resident wellness and resiliency. When creating wellness interventions, other programs should consider addressing imposter syndrome.",['(c) 2020 Baumann et al.'],"['Baumann, Natalie', 'Faulk, Carol', 'Vanderlan, Jessica', 'Chen, Justin', 'Bhayani, Rakhee K']","['Baumann N', 'Faulk C', 'Vanderlan J', 'Chen J', 'Bhayani RK']","['Resident Physician, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.', 'Instructor in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.', 'Clinical Instructor, Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.', 'Chief Resident in Quality and Patient Safety, Department of Medicine, John Cochran VA Medical Center.', 'Associate Program Director, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201110,United States,MedEdPORTAL,MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,101714390,IM,PMC7666839,['NOTNLM'],"['Burnout', 'Impostor Phenomenon', 'Impostor Syndrome', 'Residency', 'Self-Regulated Learning', 'Well-Being/Mental Health', 'Wellness']",2020/11/19 06:00,2020/11/19 06:00,['2020/11/18 06:00'],"['2020/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11004 [doi]', '11004 [pii]']",epublish,MedEdPORTAL. 2020 Nov 10;16:11004. doi: 10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Equipping leaders to thrive in VUCA environments requires more than merely imparting a list of competencies that can be observed, described, and measured. Indeed, competency-based leadership training runs the risk of being insufficient, incongruous, idealized, fragmented, and unconsciously coercive. Rather than helping leaders develop the more elusive and subtle leadership qualities and attributes necessary to thrive in VUCA environments, competency-based training can leave them feeling inadequate, as if they do not ever quite measure up, and can fuel ""imposter syndrome"". The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) Mid-Career Leadership Institute provided training that was far more than competency based. It was broad enough to be relevant to fellows working in a variety of contexts and provided a framework directly applicable across settings. The training was multipronged and included: a 2 day in-person workshop designed to maximize active participation; intensive mentoring by both peers and senior members of SBM; three individual one-on-one executive coaching sessions with a professional career coach; and a leadership project in which we applied the knowledge gained during our training in our diverse organizational settings. The SBM Mid-Career Leadership Institute training increased my self-awareness about important leadership concepts, the executive coaching sessions helped me become more productive, and the relationships I built have helped me develop my professional network and deepen my connection with fellow scientists and practitioners.

It can cause various problems, including anxiety, self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, and therefore has significant potential to adversely affect personal and professional development. AIM: To critically explore the concept of imposter syndrome among early-to-mid career nurse researchers. DISCUSSION: There may be several reasons why imposter syndrome is common among nurse researchers. Evidence suggests it is ubiquitous in other academic disciplines across the higher education sector, particularly in early-to-mid career researchers. It is unclear how or why nurse researchers are affected by this phenomenon, and whether feeling like an imposter is problematic in this context. CONCLUSION: Imposter syndrome can be deeply unsettling, particularly at times of specific exposure or peer review. It is relatively normal for even the most experienced, successful researchers to feel like this. Related feelings of self-doubt and critical self-reflection are essential in appropriate measures to research and can reduce researchers' potential for making significant mistakes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: When managed appropriately, imposter syndrome can be important in scholarly activity and ongoing personal and professional development. Recognising this is an important first step in mitigating related feelings of inadequacy.","['(c)2020 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

We doubt that there is a single woman in any surgical field who has not experienced both implicit and explicit bias. Many of the issues facing women in surgery seem to be mirrored in both the developed and developing countries. There is little literature describing the exact situation in Africa. South African government institutions have made a concerted effort to improve the representation of minorities in business, education and the health sector. In the hospital setting, hiring is done by means of a quota system based on demographics within that particular sector. This has also resulted in a number of unforeseen epistemic biases. This policy-driven 'forced' hiring of female candidates also led to feelings of doubt in the candidates themselves about their merits and competence and capabilities. This epistemic bias can then filter down, feeding the already prevalent imposter syndrome and confidence issues felt by many female surgical trainees. Not only do we need to aim to change the culture in surgical departments by changing the image of the 'stereotypical surgeon', we need to extend this message out into our training institutions, communities and peoples' homes. We believe that this is the only way to change a culture steeped in implicit bias, to be more inclusive of women and other minority groups and shed the assumption that they are lesser.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Individuals with IS are afraid of being discovered as intellectual frauds and attribute their successes to external qualities. METHODS: An international study explored the prevalence and severity of IS in practicing veterinarians. An anonymous survey consisting of the 20-question Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, plus additional demographic and work-related questions, was distributed online. RESULTS: A total of 941 practicing veterinarians responded. Overall, 631 participants (68 per cent) met or exceeded the clinical cut-off score for IS. Ordinal regressions found that residing in New Zealand (NZ) or the UK, being female or having been in practice for less than five years increased the odds of having a high IS score. The effect of these factors on the perceived degree of impact of IS on participants' professional and personal life was also explored. Women, UK residents and new practitioners reported higher levels of impact in their professional life. However, sex and country of residence did not affect the degree of impact on participants' personal life. CONCLUSION: Veterinarians in general have an alarmingly high prevalence of IS with young, female graduates practising in the UK and NZ at increased risk.","['(c) British Veterinary Association 2020.

Intriguingly, delusional belief was selective for both person and modality, as the patient believed that his son - not his daughter or other relatives - was substituted with an imposter only while being in presence of him and looking at his face, but not when merely listening to his voice. A neuroanatomical reconstruction obtained integrating morphological and functional patient's neuroimaging data highlighted two main peculiarities: a compression of the rostral portion of right temporal lobe due to a large arachnoid cyst, and a bilaterally reduced metabolism of frontal areas. Autonomic data obtained from thermal infra-red camera and skin conductance recordings showed that a higher sympathetic activation was evoked by the observation of daughter's face, relative to the observation of the son's face as well as of not-familiar faces; conversely, daughter and son voices elicited a similar sympathetic activation, higher relative to not-familiar voices, indicating a modality-dependent dissociation consistent with the delusional behavior. Our case supports the ""two-hit hypothesis"" about Capgras delusion etiopathogenesis: here, the first hit is represented by the right-temporal lesion impairing the association between familiar faces and emotional values, the second one is the frontal bilateral hypometabolism favoring delusional behavior.

In February 2020, the Federation of State Medical Boards and the National Board of Medical Examiners announced that Step 1 would transition to pass/fail scoring beginning in 2022.The authors discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of the pass/fail scoring change for underrepresented-in-medicine (UiM) trainees. UiM students may benefit from this change because it reduces the effect of an inequitable exam; helps correct for students who attend medical schools with a curriculum heavier on nontested formative elements; and decreases stress, improves quality of life, and undermines imposter syndrome. However, this change may also precipitate unforeseen challenges, such as increased discrimination toward UiM trainees, an increase in high-stakes test failures due to a reduced focus on preparing for standardized exams, or the development of new (e.g., subject exams) or overreliance on existing (e.g., school ranking) metrics that would make UiM residency candidates less competitive.To enhance UiM representation in the future health care workforce, it is imperative that national organizations (e.g., accrediting, licensing, regulatory, professional, honor, student, and faculty), hospitals, residency programs, and patient advocacy groups undertake a shared, rigorous approach in assessing the impact of the pass/fail scoring change on UiM applicants' selection to specialty and subspecialty residencies.",,"['McDade, William', 'Vela, Monica B', 'Sanchez, J P']","['McDade W', 'Vela MB', 'Sanchez JP']","['W.

Underrepresented groups face a complex set of barriers to achieving faculty status, including imposter syndrome, increased performance expectations, and patterns of exclusion. Institutionalized racism and sexism have contributed to these barriers and perpetuated policy that excludes underrepresented minorities. These barriers can contribute to decreased feelings of belonging, which may result in decreased retention of underrepresented minorities. Though some universities have altered their hiring practices to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the applicant pool, these changes have not been sufficient. Here we argue that departmental invited seminar series can be used to provide trainees with scientific role models and increase their sense of belonging while institutions work towards more inclusive policy. In this study, we investigated the demographics (gender and race) of invited seminar speakers over 5 years to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan. We also investigated current trainee demographics and compared them to invited speaker demographics to gauge if our trainees were being provided with representation of themselves. We found that invited speaker demographics were skewed towards Caucasian men, and our trainee demographics were not being represented. From these findings, we proposed policy change within the department to address how speakers are being invited with the goal of increasing speaker diversity to better reflect trainee diversity. To facilitate this process, we developed a set of suggestions and a web-based resource that allows scientists, committees, and moderators to identify members of underserved groups. These resources can be easily adapted by other fields or subfields to promote inclusion and diversity at seminar series, conferences, and colloquia.",['(c)2020 Author(s).

The strings in the puppet show of psychological morbidity.,189-194,10.15537/smj.2020.2.24841 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of imposter syndrome (IS) among Saudi adults and its association with burnout. METHODS: Using non-probability convenience sampling, we carried out a cross-sectional analytical study among adults in Northern Saudi Arabia. Data collection toll was a self-administered questionnaire containing young imposter scale (YIS), Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) and depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21 (DASS 21). These 3 scales are valid and reliable measurement tools for measuring IS, burnout, and psychological morbidity. RESULTS: In the study sample (n=384), imposterism was present among 222 adults (57.8%). Moderate and severe symptoms of depression were present in 217 (56.5%), symptoms of stress in 210 (54.7%), and symptoms of anxiety in 126 (32.8%). Burnout was measured in 3 domains of depersonalization, emotion exhaustion, and personal accomplishments. High degree of depersonalization was found in 221 (57.6%), higher emotional exhaustion in 246 (64.1%) while lower personal accomplishment was present in 126 (32.8%). We found statistical association between IS and gender (p less than 0.01), depression (p less than 0.001) stress (p less than 0.001) and all 3 domains of burnout (p less than 0.01). Imposter syndrome was not found associated with anxiety (p=0.97). Young imposter scale score was associated with all the 3 domains of burnout even after controlling for depression, anxiety, and stress. CONCLUSION: Imposter syndrome is frequent among Saudi adults and associated with all 3 burnout domains. Mental health domains like burnout, depression, stress, and anxiety were found associated with IS.",,"['Alrayyes, Saad', 'Dar, Umar F', 'Alrayes, Musab', 'Alghutayghit, Ahmed', 'Alrayyes, Nouf']","['Alrayyes S', 'Dar UF', 'Alrayes M', 'Alghutayghit A', 'Alrayyes N']","['College of Medicine, Jouf Universityl, Sakaka, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

High stress during training has the potential to cause burnout, a well-studied phenomenon in medical trainees. Burnout has previously been shown to increase the risk of mental health problems and medical error in trainees. Little research has been done on the impact of stress on new fellows in general and pediatric cardiology fellows in particular; understanding common sources of stress offers the opportunity to design targeted interventions to support trainee wellness. New trainees in Boston Children's Hospital's Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship program were asked to answer to the following question at the beginning of their training: ""What are you afraid of in the coming year?"" A qualitative content analysis was done on their anonymous responses. Responses were coded and analyzed for common themes. The overall analysis found that 83% of fellows reported fear of ""fellowship/career responsibilities."" The second most common theme was ""failure/disappointment"" (78%) followed by ""personal life"" (74%), ""emotional exhaustion"" (61%); least common was ""new hospital environment"" (37%). The most common individual fear was ""increased clinical responsibility"" reported by 65% of the new fellows, while 62% reported fears of ""imposter syndrome,"" and 58% about ""burnout.""

Virtually, all previous descriptions of CDS have related to calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) arthropathy. METHODS: We prospectively identified a total of twenty-four consecutive inpatients with Crowned dens syndrome from January 2016 to December 2017 in our institution. RESULTS: All patients (age range 54 to 87 years, 67% females) presented with acute onset pain in the upper neck and/or occiput accompanied with extreme neck stiffness. Most patients (79%) had elevated inflammatory markers. Four patients underwent temporal artery biopsy, which was negative for arteritis in all cases, and one was subjected to lumbar puncture, which was non-contributory. Seventeen patients (71%) had known rheumatic disease on presentation: 10 patients had the diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate arthropathy, 3 patients had ankylosing spondylitis, 2 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 1 patient had Behcet's disease, and 1 suffered from Familial Mediterranean Fever. In 4 more patients, crowned dens syndrome was the presenting symptom of calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease. All patients were treated with glucocorticoids as 0.5 mg/kg prednisone plus colchicine 0.5 mg bid resulting in dramatic improvement in both clinical (head/neck pain alleviated and cervical spinal mobility regained) and laboratory measures. CONCLUSIONS: Crowned dens syndrome should be considered, and craniocervical junction imaged in the context of acute cervical or occipital pain with stiffness and elevated inflammation markers not only in patients previously diagnosed with calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate arthropathy but also in diverse clinical settings.Key Points* This report highlights that crowned dens syndrome should be considered in various clinical setting besides calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) arthropathy.* Vigilance to this syndrome allows rapid treatment and may spare the patient unnecessary invasive procedures (i.e., temporal artery biopsy or lumbar puncture).",,"['Awisat, Abid', 'Rosner, Itzhak', 'Rimar, Doron', 'Rozenbaum, Michael', 'Boulman, Nina', 'Kaly, Lisa', 'Silawy, Amal', 'Jiries, Nizar', 'Ginsberg, Shira', 'Hussein, Haya', 'Slobodin, Gleb']","['Awisat A', 'Rosner I', 'Rimar D', 'Rozenbaum M', 'Boulman N', 'Kaly L', 'Silawy A', 'Jiries N', 'Ginsberg S', 'Hussein H', 'Slobodin G']","['Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel. abid.awisat@gmail.com.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Internal medicine B, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Internal medicine B, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, 47 Elyahu Golumb St, 3339419, Haifa, Israel.', 'Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191112,Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate arthropathy', 'Craniocervical junction', 'Crowned dens syndrome', 'Rheumatic disease imposter']",2019/11/13 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10067-019-04822-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10067-019-04822-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2020 Feb;39(2):571-574. doi: 10.1007/s10067-019-04822-9.

At 6 monthly sessions, participants learn relevant content (imposter syndrome, strengths, change style, career management, assertive communication, feedback, personal influence, conflict management, negotiation, importance of mentors, resilience, and self-care); exchange ideas; and expand their professional networks. Here, we report changes in participants' career skills/knowledge, confidence, and perceptions of the current environment after attending the program. Method: Between 2014 and 2017, participants (N = 65) completed pre- and post-program surveys that assessed career knowledge and skills, confidence, and perceptions of the current environment and provided program feedback. Results: Most skills showed pre-post significant improvement. The greatest increases occurred in knowing paths to promotion, tailoring communication style, ability to manage conflict, and ability to handle personal-professional role balance. Women reported a significant increase for all items measuring confidence. Among these items, establishing networks, understanding institutional culture, providing feedback, motivating others, strategic planning, delegating, and conflict management had the largest increases. Overall, 89.3% of respondents rated the program impact as very strong/profound, 98.5% rated the concepts as essential, 95.2% rated the skills as essential, and 90.8% rated the sense of community with women in their class as very/extremely close. Conclusions: Work-related skills/knowledge, confidence, and perceptions of the current environment increased significantly among program participants. These early-career women faculty indicated that the program augmented the skills needed to develop their careers in an academic medical center.",,"['Danhauer, Suzanne C', 'Tooze, Janet A', 'Barrett, Natalie Am', 'Blalock, Jamie S', 'Shively, Carol A', 'Voytko, Mary Lou', 'Crandall, Sonia J']","['Danhauer SC', 'Tooze JA', 'Barrett NA', 'Blalock JS', 'Shively CA', 'Voytko ML', 'Crandall SJ']","['Department of Social Sciences and Health Policy, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Office of Faculty Affairs, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Physician Assistant Studies, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology-Comparative Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Physician Assistant Studies, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190716,United States,Glob Adv Health Med,Global advances in health and medicine,101584936,,PMC6636414,['NOTNLM'],"['career development', 'faculty development', 'physicians', 'scientists', 'wellness', 'women']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2164956119862986 [doi]', '10.1177_2164956119862986 [pii]']",epublish,Glob Adv Health Med. 2019 Jul 16;8:2164956119862986. doi: 10.1177/2164956119862986. eCollection 2019.,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2003-9805'],,,,,['UL1 TR001420/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Here, we describe a 69-year-old man with CS who presented to the Kemal Arikan Psychiatry Clinic with an ongoing belief that his wife had been replaced by an identical imposter. MRI showed selective anterior left temporal lobe atrophy. Quantitative EEG showed bilateral frontal and temporal slowing. Neuropsychological profiling identified a broad range of deficits in the areas of naming, executive function, and long-term memory.

Mentors need to know how to discuss these reactions because they can also influence the mentoring process and academic performance.

Clinical nurse specialists are not immune to this phenomenon. The purpose of this article is to describe an educational program designed to assist healthcare professionals, including clinical nurse specialist students, in identifying, understanding, and addressing imposter syndrome. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: Interprofessional students from 8 professions came together for a 2-week interprofessional education experience that included a 1-day workshop. After experiential team building and small group encounters with complicated standardized patients, students were introduced to the imposter syndrome. Students completed the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and engaged in rich dialogue about the phenomenon, its effects, and personal strategies to overcome its impact. OUTCOME: When surveyed using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, clinical nurse specialist students consistently had high imposter tendencies. As a result of the program, students expressed feelings of liberation and empowerment. CONCLUSION: Clinical nurse specialist students can be impacted by the imposter syndrome, which has a potential to decrease their confidence, thus limiting their ability to practice at their highest potential. Programs that empower the clinical nurse specialists to recognize and address this phenomenon may increase their ability to optimize their role in healthcare.",,"['Haney, Tina Sweeney', 'Birkholz, Lorri', 'Rutledge, Carolyn']","['Haney TS', 'Birkholz L', 'Rutledge C']","['Author Affiliations: Assistant Professor and Co-Director for the Clinical Nurse Specialist Program (Dr Haney), Adjunct Faculty (Dr Birkholz), and Professor and Graduate Program Director (Dr Rutledge), Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Nurse Spec,Clinical nurse specialist CNS,8709115,N,,,,2018/06/08 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/NUR.0000000000000386 [doi]', '00002800-201807000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Nurse Spec. 2018 Jul/Aug;32(4):189-194. doi: 10.1097/NUR.0000000000000386.,4,,,20180611,"['*Education, Nursing', 'Humans', 'Nurse Clinicians/*education', 'Nursing Education Research', 'Nursing Evaluation Research', '*Self Efficacy', 'Students, Nursing/*psychology/statistics & numerical data']",,,,,,,,,,

The term DMS is an umbrella term which may cover disorders whose definition extends to objects other than people, such as animals, places, or familiar material objects. The most common and best known DMS is Capgras syndrome. In this disorder, the misidentification leads to the delusional conviction that a close friend or relative has been replaced by an identical - or almost identical - ""double,"" whose original has disappeared. This double is an imposter without name or identity. Most often considered as a persecutor, the double may be subjected to aggression, which may be very violent. Neuropsychological hypotheses based on cerebral dysfunctions are now commonly considered to be at the origin of the disorder. They have been elaborated from achievements in the neurosciences, particularly the facial recognition models. In return, knowledge about the normal cognitive processes involved in recognition and familiarity has benefited from the work that cognitive neuropsychiatry has invested in these disorders. The DMS are observed in various contexts of morbidity: primary psychiatric diagnosis, or secondary to various organic disorders, particularly in neurodegenerative disease; they are rarely met in isolated form. Most often, they develop in line with the associated pathology. In the absence of consensual clinical description, the epidemiology of DMS is uncertain; they may be more frequent than previously supposed. There is no specific treatment for these disorders; neuroleptics are generally used in association with treatment of the concomitant disorder. The frequent association of DMS with organic disorders which may be curable and the particularly dangerous profile of these patients are factors that underline the need for better screening.","['(c) 2018 S.

Feedback may be useful for navigating these feelings, but only if it matches a physician's self-assessment; self-doubt and the imposter syndrome are examples of inaccurate self-assessments that may affect receptivity to feedback. The impact of real or imagined underperformance on seemingly competent physicians is poorly understood. This study aimed to develop a deeper understanding to identify strategies to support all physicians who struggle. METHOD: In 2015, 28 physicians were interviewed about their experiences with underperformance. Early in the data collection process, participants spontaneously identified the imposter syndrome as a feature of their experiences; questions about the imposter syndrome were probed in subsequent interviews. RESULTS: Many participants-even those at advanced career stages-questioned the validity of their achievements; progressive independence and career advancement were variably experienced as ""rising to the level of your incompetence."" Not all participants identified as imposters; the imposter syndrome occurred at the extreme end of a spectrum of self-doubt. Even positive feedback could not buffer participants' insecurities, which participants rarely shared with their colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: Self-doubt variably affects clinicians at all career stages. Frequent transitions may cause a resurgence of self-doubt that may affect feedback credibility. Medical educators must recognize that it is not just the underperforming or failing learners who struggle and require support, and medical culture must create space for physicians to share their struggles.",,"['LaDonna, Kori A', 'Ginsburg, Shiphra', 'Watling, Christopher']","['LaDonna KA', 'Ginsburg S', 'Watling C']","['K.A.

Delusions are common features in DLB and, among them, Capgras syndrome represents the most frequent disturbance, characterized by the recurrent and transient belief that a familiar person, often a close family member or caregiver, has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. However, other delusional conditions near to misidentification syndromes can occur in DLB patients and may represent a major psychiatric disorder, although rarely studied systematically. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported on a female patient affected by DLB who presented with an unusual delusion of duplication. Referring to the female professional caregiver engaged by her relatives for her care, the patient constantly described the presence of two different female persons, with a disorder framed in the context of a delusion of duplication. A brain 99Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime SPECT was performed showing moderate hypoperfusion in both occipital lobes, and associated with marked decreased perfusion in parieto-fronto-temporal lobes bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: An occipital hypoperfusion was identified, although in association with a marked global decrease of perfusion in the remaining lobes. The role of posterior lobes is certainly important in all misidentification syndromes where a natural dissociation between recognition and identification is present. Moreover, the concomitant presence of severe attentional and executive deficits evocative for a frontal syndrome and the marked global decrease of perfusion in the remaining lobes at the SPECT scan also suggest a possible dysfunction in an abnormal connectivity between anterior and posterior areas.",,"['Solla, Paolo', 'Mura, Gioia', 'Cannas, Antonino', 'Floris, Gianluca', 'Fonti, Davide', 'Orofino, Gianni', 'Carta, Mauro Giovanni', 'Marrosu, Francesco']","['Solla P', 'Mura G', 'Cannas A', 'Floris G', 'Fonti D', 'Orofino G', 'Carta MG', 'Marrosu F']","['Department of Neurology, Movement Disorders Center, Institute of Neurology, University of Cagliari, SS 554 Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy. paosol29@yahoo.it.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Neurology, Movement Disorders Center, Institute of Neurology, University of Cagliari, SS 554 Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Neurology, Movement Disorders Center, Institute of Neurology, University of Cagliari, SS 554 Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Neurology, Movement Disorders Center, Institute of Neurology, University of Cagliari, SS 554 Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Neurology, Movement Disorders Center, Institute of Neurology, University of Cagliari, SS 554 Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Chair of Quality of Care and Applied Medical Technologies, Department of Public Health, Clinical and Molecular Medicine, University of Cagliari, Monserrato, Italy.', 'Department of Neurology, Movement Disorders Center, Institute of Neurology, University of Cagliari, SS 554 Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170419,England,BMC Neurol,BMC neurology,100968555,IM,PMC5395768,['NOTNLM'],"['*Capgras syndrome', '*Delusion of duplication', '*Dementia with Lewy bodies', '*Misidentification syndromes']",2017/04/21 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12883-017-0842-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12883-017-0842-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Neurol. 2017 Apr 19;17(1):78. doi: 10.1186/s12883-017-0842-1.,1,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2982-0665'],20170515,"['Aged', 'Capgras Syndrome/*complications', 'Cerebral Cortex/blood supply', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lewy Body Disease/complications/*psychology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Oximes/metabolism', 'Technetium Compounds/metabolism', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon']",,"['0 (Oximes)', '0 (Technetium Compounds)', '0 (hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime)']",,,,,,,,

How a single brain lesion could cause such a complex disorder is unclear, leading many to speculate that concurrent delirium, psychiatric disease, dementia, or a second lesion is required. Here we instead propose that Capgras and other delusional misidentification syndromes arise from single lesions at unique locations within the human brain connectome. This hypothesis is motivated by evidence that symptoms emerge from sites functionally connected to a lesion location, not just the lesion location itself. First, 17 cases of lesion-induced delusional misidentifications were identified and lesion locations were mapped to a common brain atlas. Second, lesion network mapping was used to identify brain regions functionally connected to the lesion locations. Third, regions involved in familiarity perception and belief evaluation, two processes thought to be abnormal in delusional misidentifications, were identified using meta-analyses of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. We found that all 17 lesion locations were functionally connected to the left retrosplenial cortex, the region most activated in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of familiarity. Similarly, 16 of 17 lesion locations were functionally connected to the right frontal cortex, the region most activated in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of expectation violation, a component of belief evaluation. This connectivity pattern was highly specific for delusional misidentifications compared to four other lesion-induced neurological syndromes (P < 0.0001). Finally, 15 lesions causing other types of delusions were connected to expectation violation (P < 0.0001) but not familiarity regions, demonstrating specificity for delusion content. Our results provide potential neuroanatomical correlates for impaired familiarity perception and belief evaluation in patients with delusional misidentifications. More generally, we demonstrate a mechanism by which a single lesion can cause a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome based on that lesion's unique pattern of functional connectivity, without the need for pre-existing or hidden pathology.","['(c) The Author (2016).

Methods: Anonymous survey administered online in 2014 that included demographic data, the Maslach Burnout Inventory and an IS screening questionnaire. Main outcome measures were level of burnout, and presence or absence of imposter syndrome. The presence of IS and burnout components were analyzed across age, gender, race, year of training, intention to pursue fellowship training, and greater than one year of work experience outside of medicine using chi-squared tests. The association between burnout and IS was also compared using chi-squared tests. Results: One hundred and thirty-eight students completed the questionnaire. Female gender was significantly associated with IS (chi(2)(3)=10.6, p=0.004) with more than double the percentage of females displaying IS than their male counterparts (49.4% of females versus 23.7% of males). IS was significantly associated with the burnout components of exhaustion (chi(2) (2)=5.9, p=0.045), cynicism (chi(2)(2)=9.4, p=0.004), emotional exhaustion (chi(2)(2)=8.0, p=0.018), and depersonalization (chi(2) (2)=10.3, p=0.006). The fourth year of medical school was significantly associated with IS (chi(2)(3)=10.5, p=0.015). Conclusions: Almost a quarter of male medical students and nearly half of female students experience IS and IS was found to be significantly associated with burnout indices. Given the high psychological morbidity of these conditions, this association cannot be ignored. It behooves us to reconsider facets of medical education (i.e. shame-based learning and overall teaching style) and optimize the medical learning environment.",,"['Villwock, Jennifer A', 'Sobin, Lindsay B', 'Koester, Lindsey A', 'Harris, Tucker M']","['Villwock JA', 'Sobin LB', 'Koester LA', 'Harris TM']","['Department of Otolaryngology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, USA.', ""Department of Otolaryngology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Otolaryngology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Arnot Medical Services, Arnot Ogden Medical Center, Elmira, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161031,England,Int J Med Educ,International journal of medical education,101603754,IM,PMC5116369,['NOTNLM'],"['american medical students', 'impostor syndrome', 'pilot study', 'usa']",2016/11/02 06:00,2017/08/03 06:00,['2016/11/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['ijme.7.364369 [pii]', '10.5116/ijme.5801.eac4 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Med Educ. 2016 Oct 31;7:364-369. doi: 10.5116/ijme.5801.eac4.,,,,20170802,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Burnout, Professional/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depersonalization/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Stress, Psychological/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Students, Medical/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Syndrome', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,

Graduate dental hygiene education is challenged to develop programs that stimulate and nurture dental hygiene scholars as well as scientists. The need for the development of dental hygiene doctoral education is critical to strengthening our discipline's scholarly identity.The authors explore the tyranny of the ""Queen-Bee"" and the paralyzing nature of the ""Imposter Syndrome,"" as pathologic non-productive behavior patterns that create roadblocks not only for the individual to move forward, but also for the discipline as a whole. Recognizing and eliminating these maladaptive syndromes will empower the individual as well as strengthen the collective to build a strong dental hygiene scholarly identity. The significance of dynamic ""Follower-ship"" as an often undervalued concept is offered as an antidote to overcome roadblocks and energize the collective's value of a scholarly identity for dental hygiene.","[""Copyright (c) 2016 The American Dental Hygienists' Association.""]","['Walsh, Margaret', 'Ortega, Elena', 'Heckman, Barbara']","['Walsh M', 'Ortega E', 'Heckman B']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Dent Hyg,Journal of dental hygiene : JDH,8902616,D,,['NOTNLM'],"['dental hygienists', 'doctoral dental hygiene education', 'follower-ship', 'graduate dental hygiene education', 'imposter phenomenon', 'queen bee syndrome', 'scholarly identity']",2016/04/24 06:00,2017/06/28 06:00,['2016/04/24 06:00'],"['2016/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/28 06:00 [medline]']",['90/2/79 [pii]'],ppublish,J Dent Hyg. 2016 Apr;90(2):79-87.,2,,,20170627,"['Clinical Decision-Making', 'Dental Hygienists/*education/standards', 'Education, Graduate/standards', 'Fellowships and Scholarships', 'Health Education, Dental', 'Humans', 'Knowledge', 'Program Development', 'Research Personnel/education/standards']",,,,,,,,,,

Patients recognize the physical resemblance of a familiar acquaintance but feel that the identity of that person is no longer the same. Here we describe a 73-year-old male with right posterior frontal and bilateral anterior-medial frontal damage from prior brain trauma with a similar delusion of an imposter replacing his pet cat. Misidentification syndromes for animals, as opposed to humans, have been rarely reported. Neuropsychological testing showed deficits in executive processing and memory retrieval with prominent intrusions and false positive responses. The delusional belief content in Capgras syndrome has been hypothesized to result from loss of an emotional or autonomic response to familiar stimuli, from theory of mind deficits, or from loss of self-environment distinctions. We instead propose that Capgras delusions result from a dysfunction in linking external stimuli with retrieved internal autobiographical memories pertaining to that object.

Several current theoretical models of CS attribute such misidentification problems to deficits in covert recognition processes related to the generation of appropriate affective autonomic signals. These models assume intact overt recognition processes for the imposter and, more broadly, for other individuals. As such, it has been suggested that CS could reflect the ""mirror-image"" of prosopagnosia. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether overt person recognition abilities are indeed always spared in CS. Furthermore, we examined whether CS might be associated with any impairments in overt affective judgments of facial expressions. We pursued these goals by studying a patient with Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) who showed clear signs of CS, and by comparing him to another patient with DLB who did not experience CS, as well as to a group of healthy control participants. Clinical magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) atrophy that appeared to be uniquely associated with the presence CS. We assessed overt person recognition with three fame recognition tasks, using faces, voices, and names as cues. We also included measures of confidence and probed pertinent semantic knowledge. In addition, participants rated the intensity of fearful facial expressions. We found that CS was associated with overt person recognition deficits when probed with faces and voices, but not with names. Critically, these deficits were not present in the DLB patient without CS. In addition, CS was associated with impairments in overt judgments of affect intensity. Taken together, our findings cast doubt on the traditional view that CS is the mirror-image of prosopagnosia and that it spares overt recognition abilities. These findings can still be accommodated by models of CS that emphasize deficits in autonomic responding, to the extent that the potential role of interoceptive awareness in overt judgments is taken into account.",,"['Fiacconi, Chris M', 'Barkley, Victoria', 'Finger, Elizabeth C', 'Carson, Nicole', 'Duke, Devin', 'Rosenbaum, R Shayna', 'Gilboa, Asaf', 'Kohler, Stefan']","['Fiacconi CM', 'Barkley V', 'Finger EC', 'Carson N', 'Duke D', 'Rosenbaum RS', 'Gilboa A', 'Kohler S']","['Department of Psychology, The Brain and Mind Institute, University of Western Ontario London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, York University Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Schulich School of Medicine, University of Western Ontario, London ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, York University Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, The Brain and Mind Institute, University of Western Ontario London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, York University Toronto, ON, Canada ; Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Toronto, ON, Canada ; Department of Psychology, University of Toronto Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, The Brain and Mind Institute, University of Western Ontario London, ON, Canada ; Department of Psychology, York University Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140924,Switzerland,Front Hum Neurosci,Frontiers in human neuroscience,101477954,,PMC4173644,['NOTNLM'],"['Capgras syndrome', 'Lewy body dementia', 'affect perception', 'interoceptive awareness', 'person recognition']",2014/10/14 06:00,2014/10/14 06:01,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fnhum.2014.00726 [doi]'],epublish,Front Hum Neurosci. 2014 Sep 24;8:726. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00726. eCollection 2014.,,,,20141013,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed clinical characteristics of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) patients with Capgras syndrome compared to those without Capgras. METHODS: We identified 55 consecutive DLB patients (11 cases with Capgras syndrome (DLB-C) and 44 cases without evidence of Capgras (DLB). Semi-structured interviews with the patient and an informant, neurological exams, and neuropsychological testing were performed. Caregivers were assessed for caregiver burden and depression. Primary comparisons were made between DLB-C and DLB. Exploratory analyses using stepwise logistic regression and bootstrap analyses were performed to determine clinical features associated with Capgras. RESULTS: DLB-C patients experienced more visual hallucinations and self-reported anxiety, had higher scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and were less likely to be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors at time of initial evaluation. Extrapyramidal symptoms and depression were not associated with Capgras. Caregivers of DLB-C patients had higher caregiver burden. DLB-C was associated with self-reported anxiety (OR = 10.9; 95% CI = 2.6-47.6). In a bootstrap analysis, clinical findings that were predictors of Capgras included visual hallucinations (log(OR) = 18.3; 95% CI = 17.9-19.3) and anxiety (log(OR) = 2.9; 95% CI = 0.31-20.2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Capgras syndrome is common in DLB and usually occurs in the presence of anxiety and visual hallucinations, suggesting related etiopathogenesis. Early appreciation of Capgras syndrome may afford the opportunity to alleviate caregiver burden and improve patient and caregiver outcomes.",,"['Thaipisuttikul, Papan', 'Lobach, Iryna', 'Zweig, Yael', 'Gurnani, Ashita', 'Galvin, James E']","['Thaipisuttikul P', 'Lobach I', 'Zweig Y', 'Gurnani A', 'Galvin JE']","['Comprehensive Center on Brain Aging, Alzheimer Disease Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121205,England,Int Psychogeriatr,International psychogeriatrics,9007918,IM,PMC4004517,,,2012/12/06 06:00,2013/09/05 06:00,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1041610212002189 [pii]', '10.1017/S1041610212002189 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Psychogeriatr. 2013 May;25(5):843-9. doi: 10.1017/S1041610212002189.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the clinical and demographic features of subjects with Capgras syndrome differ when the syndrome is associated with neurodegenerative compared with nonneurodegenerative diseases, and whether features differ across different neurodegenerative diseases. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center. Patients Forty-seven subjects with Capgras syndrome. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of the subjects with Capgras syndrome (81%) had a neurodegenerative disease, most commonly Lewy body disease. Capgras syndrome occurred at a younger age of onset in those with a nonneurodegenerative disease (51 vs 72 years) (P < .001) co-occurring with paranoid schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and methamphetamine abuse and immediately after cerebrovascular events. Of those with Capgras syndrome and Lewy body disease, 100% had visual hallucinations compared with only one of those with Alzheimer disease (14%). CONCLUSIONS: Capgras syndrome is more commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, especially Lewy body disease, where visual hallucinations always coexist.

RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic studies reveal celiac disease to be common, occurring in approx. 1% of the population. It is being diagnosed worldwide, even in developing countries. The classic mode of presentation has become less common, with diarrhea or a malabsorption syndrome as the mode of presentation in fewer than 50% of individuals. The other major modes of presentation are iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, screening of family members, or incidentally at endoscopy done for dyspepsia or reflux. Neurological presentations may include peripheral neuropathy or ataxia. Arthritis is commonly found in patients with celiac disease when systematically sought. Patients often have a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome. Autoimmune diseases occur more frequently (three to ten times more) in those with celiac disease than the general population. However, this increased incidence of autoimmune diseases is not prevented by early diagnosis of celiac disease. SUMMARY: We will review the various associated diseases/presentations of celiac disease.

At the same time, the author has pointed out that such ever-identical <I> is also the target of the indication for the rigid designator as proposed by S. Kripke. Such problems with indication and identity, however, are closely associated with ontology presented by possible worlds semantics, an analytic philosophy that was much debated during the latter half of the 20th century. The purpose of this paper is to try to define the essence of Capgras syndrome from the viewpoint of possible worlds semantics. If Capgras syndrome is taken as suggested by the patient's statement that ""a real person has been replaced by an imposter,"" it is though that this statement refers to metaphysics with regard to the number of individuals who exist in the world. This is because the appearance of the imposter means the generation of a new individual who had not been in existence until that time. The creation of the new individual not only demands the existence of plural worlds as addressed by possible worlds semantics, but also provides a clue to solving problems with places where the real person and its imposter exist. If the number of individuals existing in the world is taken into account, it is difficult to spatio-temporally comprehend the places in which the real person and its imposter exist. Inevitably, the real person and its imposter have to be in mutually different possible worlds as defined by possible worlds semantics. This leads into the conclusion that after the onset of Capgras syndrome, the patient and the imposter are in a possible world that is different from the possible world to which the real person belongs. In the case presented herein, the patient repeatedly talked about how difficult it was to get access to the real person. If the patient was separated by space and time from the real person, his difficulty in getting access should have been only a matter of relativity. On the contrary, it is quite likely that what the patient really wanted to express is the fundamental impossibility of access that exists between two individuals who belong to mutually different possible worlds.",,"['Niiyama, Yoshitsugu']",['Niiyama Y'],"['School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Akita University.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,9801787,IM,,,,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi. 2004;106(3):281-303.,3,,,20040727,"['Aged', 'Capgras Syndrome/*psychology', 'Delusions', 'Humans', 'Male']",,,,,,,,,,57
